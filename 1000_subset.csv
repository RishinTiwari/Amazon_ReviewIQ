B01CJ3SCN2,Lasted me for years,This phone is amazing! I'm going to give an honest review. The first phone that I received did not charge but I've purchased more expensive phones with issues. I called Amazon they immediately took care of my problem and sent me another new phone the same day. This phone was made with great materials not cheaply made. The phone is very responsive the fingerprint scanner it responds immediately. The volume is loud. The screen is beautiful. It's on Android Oreo which is plenty i came from Nougat and I'm glad that I still have the Stock Android experience with an extra glaze. The battery lasts a long time it has radio. Honestly for the money that this phone is worth you will not find any phone in the market with so many Specs beautiful screen amazing speaker. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews Blu is a legit company with great prices. I will never buy a phone again just because it has a well known company logo we have come a long way in technology and Blu has shown that you don't have be one the Giants to play in the big leagues.

B00JFNDLRC,I highly recommend S5. Not considering going for S6.,"Super fast, multitasking, you can sync it to your car as phone, navigator, and consult internet at same time, it wont crash.
Super easy access to the menus. I also loaded a different Launcher that eats more memory, but it still works like a charm.
The sound is pretty loud if u use the speakers. The camera has some nice features, like double focus, 360 panorama views etc...the default gallery application is unfriendly, but you can choose another one.
Oh! The Battery ! Most important: Ok, here's the thing: If you use internet, bluetooth, wifi, phone and gps, ALL , I mean, it will last one full day, be sure about it, otherwise , if it's a normal day it lasts one day and a half.
I'm a developer as hobby, and it runs fast, you can change even the software and make it an Iphone. I bought the unlocked version obviously.

B07YX7NLXG,Great phone,"Wow. Bought this phone for my wife. She previously used the Sony Xperia Z5 but it was lost to never be found :( After getting the phone we upgraded all the Apps etc. and here is the summary:

3D scanning: Application is amazing. Fairly easy to scan, and print. We have a 3D MakerBot Replicator printer and the files readily work to print.

HotSpot: Great speed compared to the Sony Xperia Z5; For us this is a priceless function.

Slow Motion Video: I have two daughters and to catch them dancing in slow motion is amazing.

Sound: Having the 2 speakers front facing makes it sound better. Never consider this a stereo, but this is certainly better than the Z5 or other phones I shopped for.

B07H8PXT7K,First Impressions,"My Samsung Galaxy S21+ purchased refurbished from Chubbiestech looked almost new, and I was excited to take it to my local AT&T carrier's store to get it setup. The AT&T rep took the SIM card out of my older phone (which was still working fine) and made the transfer of the SIM card and all stored data over to this S21+. I was amazed how simple the AT&T rep made the transfer look, but when we turned on the S21+, we got a warning message that stated ""SIM card missing or check SIM card tray"". The phone worked fine for all tested functions, but the message continued to intermittently pop up.

The AT&T rep then overrode the physical SIM card with the input of an e-SIM or virtual SIM card and removed the physical SIM card. The phone worked fine again for tested functions, but the same warning message came up. I could press “OK” on the warning message to make the warning message go away, but its intermittent return was aggravating.

Given the refurbishment status of this phone, I was very concerned that this annoying warning message was just the “tip of the iceberg” regarding the overall quality and dependability of the phone. I had 5 or 6 online conversations with Chubbiestech to assess this issue. Included in a few specific questions I asked them was “have they seen this error message before?” and “how could it have been overlooked in their refurb testing?”. I also requested their technical opinion regarding the broader dependability of the phone.

Unfortunately, even though they showered me with “word salad” apologies, they never provided answers to my specific questions. They suggested going through the complex and expensive procedure of returning the phone to their site, but that is not a reasonable option given one’s critical dependence on a phone. I went the extra mile and brought the phone to a local smartphone repair shop, and they suggested the false warning message popping up “might” not affect the overall utility of the phone, and it “might” only be a bad sensor. The local repair shop was careful not to issue a more definitive analysis since they would have to open the phone up which might negatively impact the return policy or warrantee.

I like the phone and it appears to perform all the functions I use it for, but I feel like I am sitting on a landmine which might explode within the 90-day return timeline or worse just beyond it.

B08R7D4KZJ,It was average…for awhile,"I received my phone yesterday and quickly realized the S Pen was a random piece of plastic with Samsung's logo on it as soon as I touched it. Not only did the pen come broken (the tip is broken off so when you go to write it pushes all the way in and becomes useless) but it doesn't even feel remotely similar to a real Samsung S Pen.

Then a few hours later I go to setup my fingerprints on the phone and kept getting a error message telling me to restart my phone do the a error with the scanner. After the 3rd time restarting the phone I looked at the back to check out the fingerprint scanner and realized it's not real. Doesn't look or feel like the scanner on my other Note 8. It was replaced with a simple cap that was meant to vaguely look like the scanner but not do anything.

Then I go to plug the phone in and just be done with the whole mess for the night and find out the charger slot is messed up so that chargers do not stay in it. Tried 3 separate new chargers and all of them popped right out.

Had this phone for about a month or two now and the main issue is that half the time i plug it in to charge...it doesn't. I need to keep trying to brush out the charging port (which is clean anyway) and repeatedly plugging the charging cable in and pulling out until it works.
A few other issues include how inconsistent the fingerprint reader is, constant notifications about my mobile network and wifi connection even though both are fine and set up, and how incredible slippy the phone is in the hand and sitting on any surface - it just slides right off onto the floor if it's not completely flat ( easily solved by having a case on it of course)

B07C65MFKH,FULLY UNLOCKED BUT FROM DIFFERENT CARRIERS,"Update 12/20- Should have bought the 4gb as the camera has slowed down a bit but otherwise this is a excellent phone for the price. I have dropped this thing at least 10 times on tile, cement and asphalt with no case and have had no issue luckily. No other issues after 8 months or so.

Tired of buying flagship phones and then after two years they start to fail or slow down. I had an LG G3 which I liked but WiFi died making the phone useless after 2 years. Needed a quick replacement and so far this has been great for the money. Activated fine. I just needed to get a smaller sim and it activated right away with no issues. I would prefer a larger screen but this gives me the freedom to move to any carrier which is awesome. Rep at the ATT store was pretty impressed by the phone. 5 payments instead of 24 payments and freedom to move to any carrier. You can't go wrong.

I use the phone all day for business and it meets all my needs. I dont really need to spend another $600 for a fancier model that does the same thing. Camera is better than my LG3 but probably not as great as a Pixel but its not worth the difference to me. If you need a VERY GOOD phone for a great price this is it.

B00WJE3B38,I love it!,"Its screen isn't as fine-grained as the one on an iPhone 6+. But it's plenty good enough. I mean, these big phones have 5.5"" (diagonal) screens, and the HTC has as many pixels as my 42"" HDTV. That's more than enough for me. The HTC also has the best sound I've heard yet on a smarty phone. It has become the stereo for my recumbent trike -- along with its dashboard in general with an excellent app called the Ulysse Speedometer.

I've been happy with Virgin Mobile for some years now. This phone is the best one I've ever had on their system (or on Verizon before I got smart and ditched them). The battery supposedly can't be replaced, but I suspect something can be done about that when the time comes. There are also the ""charger"" batteries you can get that hang on the back of your phone. I have a couple of them around. The iPhone shares this problem -- at three time the HTC Desire's price. Amusing.

So I have a 13 MP camera (5 MP selfie cam) and a generally cool device that's large enough that I no longer use my 7"" tablet, but small enough to fit in my front pants pocket. To make my phone more able to stand up to life's slings and arrows (and droppages) I got a Nillkin Frosted Shield Matte Hard Back Case Cover - fits perfectly. Also, instead of the crummy, ultra thin screen protectors that inevitably bubble, I blew the Big Bucks (under $9; free shipping with Prime) for an Optionz Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for HTC Desire 816. Hah! Feels like Gorilla Glass. We're talking serious protection here!

I agonized over this phone purchase decision for several weeks. Even with Amazon's low price (lower than Virgin's) this was a bunch of money to spend -- at least for an old guy (like me) in a Florida ""55+"" trailer park. But hah! Loudest smart phone around. Play Pandora and run the bike computer at the same time -- which this phone can totally do with no lag because its CPU and RAM are up to snuff -- and life is good.

One note, applies to most Android phones: Too much pre-installed crap-apps bog the thing down and suck battery. Eventually I'll need to root it to get rid of the cruft. Not knocking HTC here; most computing devices these days come with a lot of junk software pre-installed. And Facebook is the worst one. It's the most power-wasting app on my phone. It has GOT to go! (I can still access FB through the Chrome browser, so no loss except a power drain.)

FREE TIP: If you're on Virgin -- and for all I know, other cell providers also do this -- you can keep a spare phone around, and if your ""main"" phone needs repair, gets stolen or is otherwise out of action you can activate the spare one in a couple of minutes through Virgin's website.

B08B9SGGRS,Awesome phone,"Let me first start off by saying, the battery life on this phone is incredible compared to my iPhone 6s Plus that I currently use. I can easily get 2 days of “normal” use (text, calls, internet, twitter, IG, snapchat, etc...) on a full charge. I’m very grateful for that because my iPhone battery is terrible and needs to be charge multiple times a day at this point.

The fact that the phone is unlocked and can use multiple SIM cards is very convenient. I’ve been able to use this phone while on vacation, in place of my iPhone, on a cheap plan through Mint Mobile.

The screen quality is not the best, and is not even on par with my iPhone, but it’s adequate enough for the phone to be usable. At the price, I suppose it’s fair. The screen size is fantastic. It’s the biggest phone I’ve had, and the virtually edge-to-edge space almost makes it feel like I am using a tablet, and I like that very much.

——

NOW, let me get to the issues that irk me. Despite the amount RAM in this phone, it’s still fairly slow and lagging for what I think are simple tasks. Websites that have lengthy pages, or lots of pictures and videos, can take awhile to load and sometimes outright freeze when attempting to load. Even opening some of the “native” apps is frustrating sometimes, for example, Google Maps can take 30 to 45 seconds to load sometimes.

Talking more about the RAM, out of the 4GB built into the phone, there always seems to only be about 1.5GB available. With most apps off, force stopped, disabled, and closed, there is never a significant amount of RAM available. The most I’ve ever had at my “disposal” at one time is 2.12GB. I deleted some of the pre-installed apps I did not want, like tik-tok, but the speed and available space has not changed.

The speaker at the bottom of the phone is the worst I’ve ever had. Sounds almost as bad as the Nokia flip phone I owned before 2010! I love to use spotify and watch videos, but the lack of speaker quality makes it very difficult. Anytime I want to listen to music, I end up just using my iPhone or connecting to a bluetooth speaker.

The last issue I’ll speak on is durability. The phone does not seem as though it was put together as “tight” as it should be. If you press down on the back, you can here the body squeak and feel it move. Additionally, the raised ring around the fingerprint reader somehow started to chip and is now halfway gone. You can see the white plastic that was underneath it, now exposed. Mind you, I have never dropped this phone. I have used the included phone case very lightly because the texture is nerve-racking and uncomfortable on my hands.

All in all, the phone was not intended to me a main phone going forward, but something to “ease the load” and stress being put on my iPhone. With that being said, and considering the price, expectations shouldn’t be too high for this phone. I still believe, however, there are improvements that could be made.

B00GG63522,"Good phone, good price, good service.","I cannot praise this phone highly enough. Love it!!! It has everything I have ever wanted on a smart phone and is ultra high quality, but half the price of brand names. I don't have anything bad to say about it. Here are the good things: worked perfectly out of the box, easy to navigate and use. Fingerprint scanner easy to program and works well. Excellent outdoor camera/video quality, and very good indoors within limits imposed by tiny smart phone flashes. Has forward and rear facing cameras that both work very well, with high resolution. The video camera does great slow-motion, and the still camera has great panorama features and even allows full manual control! And the phone has great sound quality.

I'm in love with the front-facing speakers. This thing can really play music loudly and without any distortion or tinniness. I play it for hours every day without headphones, such as when working in the garage or doing housework. The speakers are as good as any external speakers I've ever owned. Nobody can believe the sound is coming from a phone--they keep looking around for a stereo system.

Battery is excellent. Even playing music through the speakers a couple hours a day, using it for calls and texts, and surfing the Internet, the battery easily lasts up to 3 days. In fact, I've had the phone for about two months and have never had it run out of battery, despite not charging it daily. I researched for a solid month before getting this phone, as I had a ton of must-haves on the list. I am sooooo glad I found this phone and made the decision to buy it. Everybody who sees it is jealous that it has more features and is higher quality than their $700 phones.

I only wish Otterbox made a case for it. I am using a $7 phone cover for it, though I didn't need to buy that. The Axon comes with one already. But I'd feel safer with an Otterbox.

B07N4M4K3Q,Check the storage/memory!!,"I ordered a OnePlus 8t from Amazon on December 19th. It was labeled as brand new in the listing, but I had to raise an eyebrow when it arrived because it had not been restored to the factory default settings and the Voicemail was pointed at a very specific number after having put in my own SIM card. However, I would assume that this used to be a carrier specific phone, and because it didn't sell, they unlocked it and removed the SIM card before reselling it at a lower price. So, it is still basically brand new, just previously opened.

The phone itself works great and is in perfect condition. It also has full battery capacity.
It did come with everything that it's supposed to when it's brand new. Both the original charger and adapter were there as well as the pre-applied screen protector.

The quality I got for the price made it well worth it. It was a long overdue upgrade from iPhone XR.
My only complaint is that I guess it isn't compatible with Wi-fi calling through Verizion. Though, that's an issue with the carrier, and not the phone. When I was through T-Mobile, I was able to utilize that feature. Something to note if anyone cares about that.

I also want to compliment the seller directly. When I was provided with the shipping options, the free shipping gave me an ETA of a week. I nearly purchased the expedited shipping in hopes of getting it before the holidays. I decided against it, and I'm glad I did because it arrived just two days later.

B093CB2R6L,"Arrive, but the charge connection didn't work","Someone wrote that when we reviewed it would be helpful to write who we purchased our phone from so other potential buyers know who to buy from and who to avoid, so I will share my experience with trying to buy a secondhand note 9.

I had originally purchased a note 9 from WIRELESS WAREHOUSE. The phone was ""Amazon Renewed"" so I figured it would be in better shape, but it wasn't the quality that I was expecting, especially with the amount of scratches on the screen and the worn-out S-pen.

Also, although the phone was supposed to be factory unlocked, the phone was locked to Sprint so it wouldn't work correctly with my Tracfone sim. For this reason, I ended up having to send back the phone.

Afterwards, I bought a 2nd note 9, this time from EDGE CELLULAR and it came in near perfect condition with the exception of two little nicks on two of the corners but other than that, the phone was flawless [although, I did pay about $50 more for this one (total $440) than the original one I bought]. One thing different about this purchase was that it came in a Samsung box with all the original accessories including some headphones.

Also, the 2nd phone was truly factory unlocked, so when I put in my Tracfone sim, it worked automatically. I'm much happier with the 2nd purchase and I think I will be keeping this one as long as it remains working well. I'll give an update in about a month or so to be sure.

Hope this helps y'all.

UPDATE: though it's been longer than a month, I just thought I'd mention that the phone is still great even in 2020. I absolutely love this Note 9 and am glad I made the purchase.

B07QBDGHGR,You tube best source,"I love this phone! I was in search of a phone not made by some random Chinese company that bought the name of some well known cell company, (Nokia, Blackberry) or just started there own name (One Plus, and many many more...) Frankly I wanted the iPhone of Android phones, without paying iPhone prices, or having to deal with IOS, all I really wanted was the build quality Apple use to have. Now having said that I have only had this phone for a week, so I have no idea if it really that great, and if I will get more then the typical 18 months out of it before it starts to act up and need replacement, however my first impression is strong and I really think it will.

Essential was started by the co-founder of Android, and while it had some road bumps at first launch, I have had zero issues buying this phone in mid December, it has been very stable. Essential promises to keep this phone up to date with security patches for 3 years, and up to date with Android OS for 2 years. Currently I have the security patch for December '17, which it downloaded immediately when I turned on the phone, and I know Android 8.0 is coming very soon. I use to buy the Nexus phones for years, and really only for the up to date security and OS, but with the Essential phone I firmly believe that may be a thing of the past. I am hoping I will not have to buy a $700+ phone just to stay up to date.

And one last thing I will touch in on, I had a Nexus 5X for a long time, liked it overall (Horrible battery life) but the one thing I did like was the form factor of a 5"" phone. I help the essential next to the 5X and they are near the exact same size, even though the essential has a 5.7"" screen size. The battery life is good overall, it has up to date high end specs, a beautiful screen, amazing build quality, you just cannot go wrong for under $500.

Things I would change
-I want a headphone port
-Even though it has 128GB of storage (Amazing!) expandable storage wouldn't hurt.
-Eliminate the bottom lip
-Removable battery
-Some OEM cases/screen protectors would be nice along with more 3rd party cases/screen protectors",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2017",Leticia,Verified Purchase,13 people found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07QBDGHGR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_4?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4,,,,,Mobile,i love this phone i was in search of a phone not made by some random chinese company that bought the name of some well known cell company nokia blackberry or just started there own name one plus and many many more frankly i wanted the iphone of android phones without paying iphone prices or having to deal with ios all i really wanted was the build quality apple use to have now having said that i have only had this phone for a week so i have no idea if it really that great and if i will get more then the typical months out of it before it starts to act up and need replacement however my first impression is strong and i really think it will essential was started by the cofounder of android and while it had some road bumps at first launch i have had zero issues buying this phone in mid december it has been very stable essential promises to keep this phone up to date with security patches for years and up to date with android os for years currently i have the security patch for december which it downloaded immediately when i turned on the phone and i know android is coming very soon i use to buy the nexus phones for years and really only for the up to date security and os but with the essential phone i firmly believe that may be a thing of the past i am hoping i will not have to buy a phone just to stay up to date and one last thing i will touch in on i had a nexus x for a long time liked it overall horrible battery life but the one thing i did like was the form factor of a phone i help the essential next to the x and they are near the exact same size even though the essential has a screen size the battery life is good overall it has up to date high end specs a beautiful screen amazing build quality you just cannot go wrong for under things i would change i want a headphone port even though it has gb of storage amazing expandable storage wouldnt hurt eliminate the bottom lip removable battery some oem casesscreen protectors would be nice along with more rd party casesscreen protectors,i love this phone i was in search of a phone not made by some random chinese company that bought the name of some well known cell company nokia blackberry or just started there own name one plus and many many more frankly i wanted the iphone of android phones without paying iphone prices or having to deal with ios all i really wanted was the build quality apple use to have now having said that i have only had this phone for a week so i have no idea if it really that great and if i will get more then the typical months out of it before it starts to act up and need replacement however my first impression is strong and i really think it will essential was started by the cofounder of android and while it had some road bumps at first launch i have had zero issues buying this phone in mid december it has been very stable essential promises to keep this phone up to date with security patches for years and up to date with android os for years currently i have the security patch for december which it downloaded immediately when i turned on the phone and i know android is coming very soon i use to buy the nexus phones for years and really only for the up to date security and os but with the essential phone i firmly believe that may be a thing of the past i am hoping i will not have to buy a phone just to stay up to date and one last thing i will touch in on i had a nexus x for a long time liked it overall horrible battery life but the one thing i did like was the form factor of a phone i help the essential next to the x and they are near the exact same size even though the essential has a screen size the battery life is good overall it has up to date high end specs a beautiful screen amazing build quality you just cannot go wrong for under things i would change i want a headphone port even though it has gb of storage amazing expandable storage wouldnt hurt eliminate the bottom lip removable battery some oem casesscreen protectors would be nice along with more rd party casesscreen protectors,1,Positive,2,1

B08DNHYQTL,Incredible earbuds,"The Sony Linkbuds S are a shrunk-down, improved version of the already excellent WF-1000XM4. I wasn't expecting this. Given the ""Linkbuds"" moniker I was expecting them to prioritize ambient sound features over all else, just like the original Linkbuds, but that simply isn't the case here.

Build: the Linkbuds S are impossibly small compared to the WF-1000XM4, Sony's previous noise canceling earphones. They actually resemble the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 in overall size and shape. They also sport a nice large touch sensitive area that no one should have trouble missing. The only gripe I do have is that the outer surface is textured and this can cause some discomfort if it rubs against the crus helix.

Case: the case is definitely one of the more pocketable out there. It's about the same size as the Airpods Pro case, but slightly shorter and narrower, albeit a bit thicker. However, it also has a textured surface which can make it a little difficult to slide in and out of pockets.

Fit: the Linkbuds S fit very similar to the Galaxy Buds 2 and deeper than the WF-1000XM4. They are a little fiddly to fit. In my case I have to rotate them back and forth to get them to seat correctly. Although Sony instructs users to rotate the buds backwards to get a good fit I actually found this uncomfortable because the buds would rub against my Crus Helix and cause discomfort. Rotating them forward slightly fixed the issue. Once the buds were in place I found the fit to be secure and that, combined with their light weight, meant that it was easy to forget they were there. My one complaint about the fit is that the buds are so small that it's very difficult to insert them without either accidentally hitting the touch area or rubbing a finger against the noise canceling microphone, resulting in some static noise.

Noise canceling: the noise canceling on the Linkbuds S is fantastic. Although the Linkbuds S are advertised as being open I actually found them to be more isolating than the WF-1000XM4s without noise canceling on. With noise canceling on I actually found the Linkbuds S to be slightly superior to the WF-1000XM4 in terms of blocking out background noise and they certainly blow the Galaxy Buds Pro/2 out of the water. I haven't had chance to test the Linkbuds S with very low frequency sounds (e.g. public transport, planes) but for blocking out office and household noise they're the best true wireless earphones I've tried.

Sound: I saved the best to last. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality of the Linkbuds S. The WF-1000XM4s were a big disappointment in this regard, with an overly dark presentation for my taste that led to recessed mids and lackluster treble. The Linkbuds S by comparison adopt a Harman-like tuning that presents mids and treble brilliantly with a satisfying bass boost that doesn't dominate the overall sound. The Linkbuds S definitely beat the WF-1000XM4s for overall sound and they're up there with the Galaxy Buds Pro/2, which are the reigning champs. Comparing the Galaxy Buds side by side with the Linkbuds S I honestly can't pick a favorite amongst the three, which I think is a very good thing.

Other: in my limited tests the transparency features are great, as with the WF-1000XM4s. The only other thing that I think is worth noting is that the Linkbuds S struggle to maintain LDAC connectivity more than the WF-1000XM4s. This isn't surprising, given the small size, but is worth considering for anyone who wants to use LDAC in challenging environments or on the go.

Wrap up: previously if I wanted to recommend a pair of true wireless earphones for someone I would have to include a 'but'. The Airpods Pro have great noise canceling but the sound isn't top tier and they don't play well with Android devices. The Galaxy Buds sound fantastic but the noise canceling isn't great and they don't play well with iOS. The WF-1000XM4s have top tier noise canceling and work well with both iOS and Android devices, but their sound isn't the best. The Linkbuds S on the other hand have top tier noise canceling, work excellent with both iOS and Android, and have excellent sound. These are now my default recommendation to anyone looking for new True Wireless earphones.

Alternative picks: If it wasn't for the better Bluetooth connectivity of the WF-1000XM4s and the improved battery life the Linkbuds S would have made the XM4s redundant. Whether the increased price is worth it for those things will be up to the individual. I think there's still a case to be made for getting the cheaper Galaxy buds over the Linkbuds S if noise canceling isn't a priority. However, I think the only reason to pay more for the Airpods Pro would be if you really like the design and/or the enhanced integration with iOS is really important.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2022",cathy s,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08DNHYQTL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2,"KZ ZSN Pro X IEM in Ear Monitor, Wired Gaming Earbuds, HiFi KZ Headphones with Hybrid Dual Driver 1ba 1dd High Fidelity Musician in-Ear Earphone with Detachable Tangle-Free Cable (Black, Without mic)",Visit the YINYOO Store,4.5 out of 5 stars,"About this item【Zinc Alloy and Resin Housing Design】 The kz zsn pro x gaming earbuds' cover is made of high quality zinc alloy while the cavity is made of imported resin, and aluminum alloy vocal cavity, The combination of different materials and the wide range of color options display a modern and eye-catching, fasionable kz zsn pro x wired earphones.【Drivers Improved】KZ ZSN PRO X in ears monitor headphones: customized balanced armature and 10mm dynamic driver, which provide excellent bass sound.

B09RMR23XL,these new TVs are not like the old TVS,"Two hours after receiving this monitor I had to send it right back. It had great picture quality and I purchased it because it was on a Macworld review of the best secondary monitors for a Mac desktop. However, I work at a college and when I set it up I had three issues with it:

1) The most annoying was a popup that kept happening asking me if I wanted to allow/deny any bluetooth enabled device that walked past my office. In a college setting you can probably imagine that happened a lot...about 20 times within the two hours I had it set up. It did it for every device even if people weren't trying to connect AND it also triggered a question on their phones asking them if they wanted to connect which I did NOT want to happen. After 1 hour on the phone with Samsung tech support we found this is not a feature that can be turned off. So this is the primary reason I returned it as I don't want to keep denying every device that walks by my office every day.

2) Usually with my Mac, devices are just plug and play with no fuss. This one was hard to connect and took about 15 minutes of playing around with settings. Not easy and I felt like this might be a struggle every day when the computer turned on.

3) The monitor is really more of a tv. Every time you let the monitor sit idle for more than a minute it would go back to the Samsung home screen where it started playing the Samsung TV network and it got super annoying.

So two hours later, this ""monitor"" was sent right back. If you want a monitor/tv with great picture quality and you DON'T have anyone around you with a bluetooth (I would bet this pop-up would happen a lot in apartments too) then buy it, but if you are in a commercial work environment it is not worth the hassle.",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2023",Ruth,,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09RMR23XL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_6?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6,"LG B2 Series 65-Inch Class OLED Smart TV OLED65B2PUA, 2022 - AI-Powered 4K, Alexa Built-in, Black",Visit the LG Store,4.3 out of 5 stars,"About this itemWith LG's 8 million self-lit OLED pixels, you'll get a vivid viewing experience with infinite contrast, deep black, and over a billion colors that add depth and bring out the best in whatever you're watching.Audio Output Power 20W, Bluetooth Support : Version 5.0.Batteries Required: ‎NoEngineered especially for LG, the advanced α7 Gen5 AI Processor 4K algorithmically adapts and adjusts picture and sound quality for a lifelike viewing experience with depth and rich colorGet in the action with an impressive 120Hz refresh rate that keeps up with the fast movement in sports, video games, and movies for a sharp picture with smooth motion from start to finishLG Game Optimizer mode with NVIDIA G-SYNC, FreeSync Premium, and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) improve your gaming experience with fluid on-screen motion.

B0BNNMYSGQ,Great quality and comfortable to wear.,"With my Bose headphones beginning to hic-up, I was looking hard for a replacement. Didn't want to dump $150 on another pair of Bose quite yet, and took a chance on these. Audio quality is great, every bit as good as my expensive Bose! BlueTooth was quick and easy too. I use with a Mighty, and there no problem connecting it. What I would do to improve them: I would say that the flat cord connecting left and right is a little unweildy ... and perhaps a bit shorter than I'd like. A softer, perhaps round cable would be an inexpensive and effective solution for the company.

First is the sound variation and the reason this isn't 5 stars. The sound on the commercials is SO loud. It's not every commercial and Most TV's now have a setting to fix this issue or adjust it to make it better. This TV does not. So, we end up having to mute the TV during commercials. It's a small complaint, but it's quite annoying. The second complaint isn't really applicable to everyone. We use streaming services in addition to an antenna. This TV has a Live TV section for that to work perfectly. However, since the remote has no numbers, you have to scroll through each and every channel to get to the one you want.

B08B3QSVM6,"Rápido, falta foto panorámica.","Purchased this phone to replace an off-brand that we kept having trouble with (one+). This Samsung represented one of the last phones to allow user-installed memory. That's a good reason to buy right there!!! The wireless charging is also a must have, and this works great.

Overall I have found this model has been very durable, two have lasted over three years on our account with a slight decline in battery life.

B0C7LNLS9P,Cheap quality phone.,"As advertised: Certified manufacturer refurbished. I have now ordered both the silver and the grey versions of this watch from this vendor. Super fast delivery, brand new condition, and working flawlessly. They come in a plain white box with no manual (available on Samsung's site), but include a new charger (love it!), cable, watch, and small/large silicone bands all there in new bags. An absolute steal, and they work perfectly. Added a silver stainless steel band to the silver one and a black one to the dark grey. Both look fantastic and really class up the watch even further. Have fully embraced Samsung's Gear app for my Android phone, which makes setting up and changing watch faces easy. Also use Watchmaster, available for free download, which works similarly to the Samsung app in that you can change out faces, both paid and free. Very high quality faces, and more coming every day. Shipping from this vendor was extremely fast. Had both in 3 days--impressive. I have had great luck with manufacturer refurbished electronics of all types and these do not disappoint.

The good side:

Nokia Maps is perfect for me. Fast, accurate, with voice navigation and free worldwide.
The capacitive screen works great.

16GB internal.
The box accessories (car holder,etc.)

The bad side:
Symbian. This software is old and not cause my version (i have the last available) the soft design and conception is like 2 years old if we compare with another players (android,iOS..). I found SPB Shell in the Ovi Store that make really better my relation with this phone. Without it, i would be hating it.
Another oldie, is the music player. It's awful and not friendly.
And you won't have an udpate to a new Symbian 3 version (like the N8 got) It's not the Nokia style.

But like i said, you'll have a nice feature phone with an old software (SPB thanks for the help!). Nice size (not big as a 4"" screen), good battery life (of course 3g/wifi/music can kill it in a day) and a lot of internal space.
I had in my hands the N8 too, with Symbian 3. Forget it, nothing relevant. Of course it's better than this X6 but i'wont pay $550 (10/2010) for it even crazy.

B01GSOS364,Excellent reviews........ awesome phone. battery lasts forever,"I was in love with the phone until I discovered two flaws. The first flaw is the proximity sensor. When you're on a call, the screen goes black, as it should. However, you can't get out of that black screen. You are LITERALLY stuck with a black screen. Even the power button WON'T wake the phone from that black screen. The person you're on the phone with has to end the call, or you'll be stuck removing the battery each time you want to end the call. That is very frustrating! The only way around this issue is to disable the proximity sensor, but why should you have to? The second problem with this phone is that when the phone is in sleep mode, the phone will not wake up for incoming calls. You can hear the phone ringing, but the phone will not turn on; you are not able to see the caller ID image or the phone number of the person calling you. You have to press the power button TWICE just for the phone to come out of wake mode so that you can see the incoming call. I've NEVER had these problems with any of my android phones. With the exception of those two flaws, the phone is very nice!

B0D6G63LFV,Great quality,"The note 8 is an amazing phone!
I got this phone from SmartTech Store and it came within 5 days, 1 day earlier than the date provided. The note 8 is a beautiful device with glossy glass on the front and back. The phone feels comfortable in the hand and if you're used to big phones such as the sd edge plus, the fingerprint scanner placement won't be a problem! The dual camera is amazing and that live focus is easy to use. Bixby vision is useful if you want to find something similar to what you're looking at but not so much for finding it to buy. The iris scanner is quick and accurate, the fingerprint scanner is very snappy and unlocks without having to press the power button first. Battery life is average but that is expected because of the massive screen!
the s-pen is quite useful for translating things on web pages and is good for making off-screen notes such as shopping lists. The screen is amazing, it is so bright and big and the bezels are quite small.
Software is easy to navigate and use, it has tutorials for features that you haven't used yet which is useful if you don't know about the new updated software features and gestures. Speaking of gestures, the fingerprint scanner can also be used to pull down and push up the notification bar so that's a nice little trick. The front camera is amazing and captures many details in pictures.

B0CSB14R7J,Phone Box was open,"Great phone. Met my expectations and is another solid phone from Blu (I had the Studio 5.0C HD).

Pros:
* Very fast. Doesn't feel laggy at all.
* Small and Light. Sometimes its a con since I don't feel it in my pocket or with me on the bed.
* Nice Resolution. I needed an HD Display for reading/seeing movies on the way and looks great.
* Nice battery time. I can be sometimes with 2 (or 3) days without recharging it and its still there.

Cons:
* No additional space. I don't need that much space but I know I can't carry my full music collection on this phone.
* Gets hot on heavy usage. I don't mind too much but its noticeable when playing games that the top back gets somehow warm. Probably due to the small form factor.

B0CCP7GW4M,EXCELLENT BOOK,"Author Ramin Setoodeh interviewed Donald Trump quite a number of times for his best-selling book, ""Apprentice in Wonderland” over a 20-year period. In the early 2000s many viewers were entertained and amused by ""The Donald’s"" showmanship on NBC’s “The Apprentice” and ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" They were my favorite must-see TV shows as my career was in advertising, marketing and show business (Disney Studios for 15 years). The challenges on those shows were like the World Series to me.

Nowadays far more people are horrified and revolted by the despicable dishonesty of the convicted felon he is today and will be forever more. Yet, MAGATs and Evangelicals still blindly believe ""the pretend ruler"" (Setoodeh's words) won the 2020 election because he told them ad nauseum that he believed he won.

However, in a recent follow-up interview for the book with the convicted felon about Geraldo Rivera on ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" Setoodeh writes on Page 191:

""When I ask Trump whether they're still on good terms, he tells me a story. 'After I lost the election...,' Trump says. These words come tumbling from his mouth, almost against his will, and he winces in surprise. It's a moment of candor that catches Trump off guard; even he can’t believe he said it. The spin artist takes immediate control, trying to erase this humiliating gaffe of speaking the truth, one that could alienate his base and cost him his pride.”

The convicted felon “corrects” himself and repeats the Big Lie yet again. And later in the book, while several WHITE former Apprentice contestants claim Trump isn't a racist, Arsenio Hall would beg to differ with them.

B006ULGWPK,Good phone!!,"This thing is really impressive in a different way. My wife needed a new phone after a drop+shatter and a new contract was not an option because of the terrible deals we were offered. So I elected to grab one of these and it was a good choice.
Pros:
-LTE, big upgrade. And the 410 processor along with the LTE option is snappy
-Super comfy to hold, way way more comfortable than my s4, perfect size.
-screen size is ideal, one handed use friendly (seems to be a rare thing recently)
-unreal battery life
-for lack of a better description... its adorable
-very close to stock android (biggest pro for sure, keeps it snappy and updates are quick, go moto!)

Cons
-low res screen (but def sharp enough, she never complained once, and the resolution results in great battery life)
-no flash and weaker cameras, not bad just not amazing and low light is a no no.

Overall its amazing value, does 85% of what a flagship for a fifth of the price. It has everything you need and nothing you don't.

B09WNJT9X3,Good budget option,"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at
50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.

I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.

Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.

I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.

I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.

Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.

Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.

Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.

So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV. I did for my purposes--got a great monitor, much better movie viewing in my office when I so desire and it's not really hard to operate and handle many inputs. I'd buy another HISENSE as a main TV on their upper tier.

B07RWFC6NY,Alright phone but there's better,"So far I am loving the Xperia 1 III. The front camera is better than the rear of my old phone (LG V60, another great phone though), the three rear cameras are also very versatile and have a great optical zoom (up to 4.4x).

You can however turn the refresh down to 60hz to save a bit of power, but stamina mode works well to keep the phone going in an emergency. Fingerprint scanner works the best of any phone or computer I've had. Never fails to read. Very fast and responsive, calls sound great and the speakers are better than some laptops.

B07WG9TNMW,Do not buy this phone.,"I have no complaints about this phone. Initially it's seems like it's exactly as advertised, a cheaper option to top end brand-name devices, but as you use it and if you took the time to look at the specs you'll quickly realize this baby is almost perfect. I'll admit it's rear camera is probably it's weakest aspect, you'll find top end devices kill it in that comparison, but it's front facing cam can go toe to toe with most of those phones. It's screen is also a little on the small side, but you won't be squinting due to its beautiful display and it fits comfortable in your pocket. Call quality is clear and crisp, while stereo speakers though not the loudest I've had is also clear and crisp. Additionally the interface is clean and fast, though initially it comes with some Amazon bloatware that's easily removed and mostly disabled after your first system software update. Internationally unlocked. Works in the Caribbean. All of this makes it out to be the perfect take-with-you-anywhere media/communication device.

B00AKG2XSQ,Product not as shown in image,"This device is so very, very close to being a great android phone. There are a few significant issues unfortunately, which made me return this phone to go back to a Nexus 5X.

First because it's easiest to explain: the screen collects scratches very easily. In addition, you won't find a great screen protector due do the 2.5D glass. It's minor (they're not huge scratches), but noticeable. Having a stronger glass would have been a huge step up (and a reasonable thing, given this isn't an entry level $100 phone).

Second: EMUI, Huawei's custom android. Hear me out.

The actual UI changes I could get used to. Some are actually nice, and there are some good features built in (apparently you can have two different Facebook logins, for example). Some is just different but okay, like the lock screen. It's also easy to tweak away a lot of this stuff.

What I couldn't move past is not being able to use stock, normal Google apps like Phone, Contacts, Messenger, etc. This destroyed the phone for me. Some you can disable to go back to the Google version in Play Store (simple example is Calculator). Some you can't disable for no discernible reason (I want to say Calendar is one), and some you can't disable but I at least get why (Phone).

The biggest pain was Messenger for SMS/MMS. It's different, and while some of the UI is nice, there are just weird things it does wrong. It had issues bringing in my Google contacts (so many threads showed up as unknown, even though I had contacts for those numbers). It behaved oddly with MMSs (included extra text like ""No subject"" if someone just sent a picture alone).

The contacts app is also a huge step down from the stock Contacts app, and you can't revert back. Phone is also a step down but Phone is just an app I hardly ever use on my phone.

If this phone had stock android OR just cosmetic additions with standard, normal Google apps -- this is a 4.5 to 5 star phone for the price. It's really well built, has pretty nice performance, has USB-C and a fingerprint reader, and isn't too expensive. But EMUI kills it and drags it down to not worth the price.",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2017",April,Verified Purchase,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00AKG2XSQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_6?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6,,,,,Mobile,this device is so very very close to being a great android phone there are a few significant issues unfortunately which made me return this phone to go back to a nexus x first because its easiest to explain the screen collects scratches very easily in addition you wont find a great screen protector due do the d glass its minor theyre not huge scratches but noticeable having a stronger glass would have been a huge step up and a reasonable thing given this isnt an entry level phone second emui huaweis custom android hear me out the actual ui changes i could get used to some are actually nice and there are some good features built in apparently you can have two different facebook logins for example some is just different but okay like the lock screen its also easy to tweak away a lot of this stuff what i couldnt move past is not being able to use stock normal google apps like phone contacts messenger etc this destroyed the phone for me some you can disable to go back to the google version in play store simple example is calculator some you cant disable for no discernible reason i want to say calendar is one and some you cant disable but i at least get why phone the biggest pain was messenger for smsmms its different and while some of the ui is nice there are just weird things it does wrong it had issues bringing in my google contacts so many threads showed up as unknown even though i had contacts for those numbers it behaved oddly with mmss included extra text like no subject if someone just sent a picture alone the contacts app is also a huge step down from the stock contacts app and you cant revert back phone is also a step down but phone is just an app i hardly ever use on my phone if this phone had stock android or just cosmetic additions with standard normal google apps this is a to star phone for the price its really well built has pretty nice performance has usbc and a fingerprint reader and isnt too expensive but emui kills it and drags it down to not worth the price,this device is so very very close to being a great android phone there are a few significant issues unfortunately which made me return this phone to go back to a nexus x first because its easiest to explain the screen collects scratches very easily in addition you wont find a great screen protector due do the d glass its minor theyre not huge scratches but noticeable having a stronger glass would have been a huge step up and a reasonable thing given this isnt an entry level phone second emui huaweis custom android hear me out the actual ui changes i could get used to some are actually nice and there are some good features built in apparently you can have two different facebook logins for example some is just different but okay like the lock screen its also easy to tweak away a lot of this stuff what i couldnt move past is not being able to use stock normal google apps like phone contacts messenger etc this destroyed the phone for me some you can disable to go back to the google version in play store simple example is calculator some you cant disable for no discernible reason i want to say calendar is one and some you cant disable but i at least get why phone the biggest pain was messenger for smsmms its different and while some of the ui is nice there are just weird things it does wrong it had issues bringing in my google contacts so many threads showed up as unknown even though i had contacts for those numbers it behaved oddly with mmss included extra text like no subject if someone just sent a picture alone the contacts app is also a huge step down from the stock contacts app and you cant revert back phone is also a step down but phone is just an app i hardly ever use on my phone if this phone had stock android or just cosmetic additions with standard normal google apps this is a to star phone for the price its really well built has pretty nice performance has usbc and a fingerprint reader and isnt too expensive but emui kills it and drags it down to not worth the price,0,Negative,0,0

B00MWI4KKE,"Price is Good, Performance is Great","I love this phone. Keep in mind it is absolutely enormous -- a little unwieldy to use with only one hand at a time -- but big is what I was looking for, and it's perfect for me. My biggest complaint about it is that it's not popular enough (yet?) to have a lot of available cases/screen protectors, and the ones I got were complete garbage -- obviously not about the phone itself, but I could see it being a concern for some customers. Overall, I would recommend this phone for someone who likes big, sturdy phones with LOTS of battery life (I left my charger at work over the weekend, used my phone as normal, and it didn't die until late Sunday) & doesn't care TOO much about picture quality (it's not bad, per se, but the camera can be a little slow to focus, which is kind of annoying when you're trying to photograph an eight-month old kitten).",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2019",J.

B07Y5R5NX1,Arrival day changed,"I'm not reviewing the phone Note 8 - there's enough of that. I'm reviewing this Unlocked version and providing some info.

1. The one I received was intended for Verizon and as such, came with all the Vz bloatware and a 'This is not a Verizon Sim card' message when I restart the phone.
2. Turn off and disable the Verizon apps and gimmick features - battery life improves. Sorry, but I'm not telling you which ones - not an expert. It was trial and error for me.
3. I used it with MVNO Ting.com with a GSM Sim - no issues there.
4. When I tried to update the firmware through the Settings menu I kept getting a error message that stated the phone could not be verified. This leads to step 5

5. The way to upgrade the firmware was to plug the USB into a PC, select Software Upgrade from the connection selections (last one at bottom). A new drive appears in Windows. Copy all the files to your PC to a new folder. Install the Samsung drivers and the Update Program. Run the Update program and wait for the download (+4GB) .

B07PPST3TF,The screen quality isn't amazing. it's viewing angle is kinda small and it ...,"So I ordered two of these TVs on prime days so I was excited to receive them. Delivery guy put damaged side of box against wall and I didn’t notice right away. Ordered for my mom who was moving in. Her room wasn’t ready so I told driver to just put box against the wall. He put the damaged side of box which by the way was very noticeable against the wall where it stayed for a couple of weeks until moms room was ready. Took box to her room noticed damage took tv from box whole screen was shattered. I was in a panic because that’s a lot of money to me. Although it was a great deal. Contacted customer service. Could only receive refund of my money but I wanted to exchange. Was notified that no exchanges were possible as they were now out of the TVs I purchased in the same size which was 43 inch. So received refund fairly easily. Also sent to package store where returning the item was fairly easy. Which I appreciated. I did purchase same television in a bigger size and I am completely in love with this tv. My mom is elderly & it makes it so easy for her to find the programs she likes to watch. Also super easy because it’s voice activated so she just has to tell Alexa what she’s liked to watch. She can change programs, turn the volume up or down and also turn tv off just by speaking to Alexa. Only downside. My grandkids lost the remote at Christmas when they were visiting and we were unable to turn tv on until we purchased a new remote through Amazon which wasn’t cheap. While I love almost everything about this tv. Ie, it’s easy for myself and elderly mother to work as long as we have a remote to turn it on. No buttons for when it’s lost. Also has about everything you can think of installed in it. So no need for external fire stick or Roku & print is large enough for us that have vision loss to see. Easily setup especially for someone like me who is technologically challenged. First tv in years I have setup without having to beg my kids or someone else to setup. Don’t have to worry about resetting the remote because myself or my elderly mother messed it up. Only thing it doesn’t have that I know of is a built in find my remote. Although in fairness it may have and I haven’t figured that out yet. I would recommend you buy this tv and only this tv if you like to have advanced technology but are challenged like me.
I really thought I’d never be able to set up a tv ever again because technology is most of the time way over my head. Also the volume is great!! My son and grandson both have profound hearing loss and could easily hear with this tv, whereas with others you turn them up to max and because of the buzzing at that level you can’t make out what’s being said anyway. My only regret is I didn’t get to keep the 43 inch for moms room and they were out. Also make sure you get the remote keeper or some extra add on to help find it when it’s gone missing so you don’t have to spend a third of what you paid for the whole television.

B07B814C48,Holdability,"Horrible battery, but great camera.
Turned on battery savor to keep it from getting very hot.

WARNINGS for Prepaid Buyers:
Just found out it only works as a 2G phone with Mint Mobile (Tmobile/AT&T). Of course Mint did not tell me this until after I buy a SIM card and ask why I only have 1 bar.

My one start (previous) review ended up being TracFone service, not this phone. After more money spent on new SIMS and hours talking to TF telling me to buy that new SIM, found out that they deactivated my SIM & phone. THEN they tried to tell me I did it. I lost 5 years of saved up minutes and data, and my 10 year old number. No more struggling with TF.

Ting then lost my +15 year old number bc they sold me a wrong SIM card, after I specially bought one WITH customer service to get a Verizon card. They sent me Tmobile, which is 1 bar service in my area due to this 2G issue with this phone (I didn't know it was the wrong one until it was installed). They said I had to buy another company's SIM to be able to port my number back to them.

My unit actually came with samsung branded 25W charger and a Samsung branded charging cable. This was a nice surprise as normally these Amazon Renewed units don't come with first party accessories!

This all being said, the problem with Amazon Renewed is that there is not a consistent quality of product. Every phone I've gotten for other people from Amazon Renewed have come with questionable charging accessories.

So I went to TMobile to try switching the phone to them, and guess what? The IMEI is not real.

B09V6GHWDJ,We have several of these,"Out of the box, assembled, and connected to my entertainment center PC, it boasts AMAZING picture quality. I can't fathom why anyone would necessitate an 8K display; it's akin to gazing out an open window with no discernible screen door effect, even from my approximately 9ft viewing distance. The screen itself is nearly perfect.

Now, for the drawbacks:

Upon arrival, the box was entirely covered in dust. Although the box had a protective second layer of cardboard, seemingly doing its job as there were no visible holes or signs of tampering, upon opening, I discovered pervasive dust inside. Unfortunately, I couldn't remove it all, and even the speakers were affected. (Fortunately, I use a headset.) Additionally, much of the styrofoam was broken in one or more places, creating quite a mess. Fortunately, the display itself didn't show any visible damage. Assembling it solo proved to be a physical challenge due to its considerable weight and awkwardness.

Despite its high price, the display is surprisingly wobbly, posing a tip-over hazard. Many of the plastics used feel thin and inexpensive. The screw holes for the cable box mount were improperly threaded, preventing the screws from seating correctly and resulting in the box not sitting flush on the back of the stand. The magnetic cable cover doesn't sit properly, and the small plastic retainer for the one cable was broken, failing to secure the cable. The remote is diminutive and feels cheap, with buttons serving multiple functions to economize on materials. Although I didn't intend to learn a new remote control system, it seems inevitable now. Searching for Bluetooth devices induces screen glitches, but fortunately, I don't rely on Bluetooth.

Samsung could have reinforced the frame and maintained better quality control with the threaded holes, screws, and the plastic cable retainer. They could also have designed it to be less wobbly, as I fear an accidental knock could lead to disastrous consequences. Given its price, I anticipated higher quality.

In the end, it will serve its purpose, but I doubt I'll be purchasing TVs online in the future. This level of quality is expected from a $1000 or lower display, not one nearly $3000. Disappointingly, Samsung fell short of my expectations.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024",Linda Moore,Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09V6GHWDJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2,"SAMSUNG 43-Inch Class QLED 4K Q60B Series Dual LED Quantum HDR Smart TV with Alexa Built-in (QN43Q60BAFXZA, 2022 Model)",Visit the SAMSUNG Store,4.4 out of 5 stars,"About this item100% COLOR VOLUME W/ QUANTUM DOT: Bask in a billion shades of brilliant color with100% Color Volume;

B08NCFGTJ7,Basically an S20 without the S20 camera and refresh rate.,"My husband loves this phone for gaming and streaming music over the new, faster 4G (156mbps down, tested.) It's a great deal at this price (257). I got it because the cpu/gpu benchmarks are great, it has 6Gb of RAM, and 128GB of internal space should be enough to go nuts with all the apps he wants, plus it allows SD micro cards for storage. According to my research I believe it's rootable too! I haven't tried it yet but soon I shall. We haven't used the camera much so no comments on that. My husband loves the improved graphics compared to my LG V20. Games look much more 3D.

One annoying thing is that there really aren't any good screen protectors for this phone. The curved edges (which don't add anything to the visuals because they're black rather than part of the image) prevent the protectors from sticking on well. For some reason no one has made one that's just small enough to stick to the flat part without air pockets. My guess is this phone isn't very popular enough due to it's 5G incompatibility (see below.) The G7 has the same problem. Manufacturers just aren't interested in making accessories for it. Thanks to the Gorilla Glass, though, we've settled for a rugged case and no protector.

Face recognition and fingerprint work great. Reception is great even though Verizon isn't the best in our area (running on actual Verizon prepaid, not MVNO.) We got Verizon because we like to go camping in the Utah/Colorado mountains and it's supposed to be the best for the wilderness. Haven't tried it yet but I'll update if we have problems. My phone is on AT&T so we wanted a phone on another network for backup.

The phone only gets 5G Ultrawide, which costs an extra $10/month and is only available in cities -- not worth it unless you use your phone for multimedia at work where speed and reliability are critical. Casual movie streaming is fine (i.e. very good) over the current 150mbps 4G network in most populated areas. 5G Nationwide does not cost extra and is more widely available (in 2021). You need to get a more expensive phone for that though. Honestly this phone gets better speed tests than my home wifi so I have no complaints. I feel this phone almost deserves 5 stars but I knocked 1 off because the description is not crystal clear about the 5G Nationwide compatibility.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021",Roronoa Zoro,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08NCFGTJ7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_9?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9,Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ Plus 5G Enabled Verizon + GSM Unlocked 256GB Aura Glow (Renewed),Visit the Amazon Renewed Store,3.9 out of 5 stars,,Mobile,my husband loves this phone for gaming and streaming music over the new faster g mbps down tested its a great deal at this price i got it because the cpugpu benchmarks are great it has gb of ram and gb of internal space should be enough to go nuts with all the apps he wants plus it allows sd micro cards for storage according to my research i believe its rootable too i havent tried it yet but soon i shall we havent used the camera much so no comments on that my husband loves the improved graphics compared to my lg v games look much more d one annoying thing is that there really arent any good screen protectors for this phone the curved edges which dont add anything to the visuals because theyre black rather than part of the image prevent the protectors from sticking on well for some reason no one has made one thats just small enough to stick to the flat part without air pockets my guess is this phone isnt very popular enough due to its g incompatibility see below the g has the same problem manufacturers just arent interested in making accessories for it thanks to the gorilla glass though weve settled for a rugged case and no protector face recognition and fingerprint work great reception is great even though verizon isnt the best in our area running on actual verizon prepaid not mvno we got verizon because we like to go camping in the utahcolorado mountains and its supposed to be the best for the wilderness havent tried it yet but ill update if we have problems my phone is on att so we wanted a phone on another network for backup the phone only gets g ultrawide which costs an extra month and is only available in cities not worth it unless you use your phone for multimedia at work where speed and reliability are critical casual movie streaming is fine ie very good over the current mbps g network in most populated areas g nationwide does not cost extra and is more widely available in you need to get a more expensive phone for that though honestly this phone gets better speed tests than my home wifi so i have no complaints i feel this phone almost deserves stars but i knocked off because the description is not crystal clear about the g nationwide compatibility,my husband loves this phone for gaming and streaming music over the new faster g mbps down tested its a great deal at this price i got it because the cpugpu benchmarks are great it has gb of ram and gb of internal space should be enough to go nuts with all the apps he wants plus it allows sd micro cards for storage according to my research i believe its rootable too i havent tried it yet but soon i shall we havent used the camera much so no comments on that my husband loves the improved graphics compared to my lg v games look much more d one annoying thing is that there really arent any good screen protectors for this phone the curved edges which dont add anything to the visuals because theyre black rather than part of the image prevent the protectors from sticking on well for some reason no one has made one thats just small enough to stick to the flat part without air pockets my guess is this phone isnt very popular enough due to its g incompatibility see below the g has the same problem manufacturers just arent interested in making accessories for it thanks to the gorilla glass though weve settled for a rugged case and no protector face recognition and fingerprint work great reception is great even though verizon isnt the best in our area running on actual verizon prepaid not mvno we got verizon because we like to go camping in the utahcolorado mountains and its supposed to be the best for the wilderness havent tried it yet but ill update if we have problems my phone is on att so we wanted a phone on another network for backup the phone only gets g ultrawide which costs an extra month and is only available in cities not worth it unless you use your phone for multimedia at work where speed and reliability are critical casual movie streaming is fine ie very good over the current mbps g network in most populated areas g nationwide does not cost extra and is more widely available in you need to get a more expensive phone for that though honestly this phone gets better speed tests than my home wifi so i have no complaints i feel this phone almost deserves stars but i knocked off because the description is not crystal clear about the g nationwide compatibility,0,Negative,2,1

B0BCPC5JRV,AKG full range quality,"If you are looking for quality sound, spend the extra money on something else. These do the job for general use so they aren't a bad buy. I consider these a ""throw away"" set, though. I only use when my higher end buds lose charge or when I don't want to risk losing them.

Drivers are small so don't expect booming bass. I would say these are midrange - they don't have the richer highs and lows you get from higher end products. Given the price I don't expect them to.

With respect to tangling, these are ok. They tend to twist where it splits so you end up with the wires directly sort of tied under your chin. When it does get tangled, the material seems to cling together and doesn't give. I could easily see someone breaking these if they pulled too much trying to get out a knot.

B088N6KHHD,Don't even think about it!,"The Google Pixel 2 XL is a monster of a smartphone, and an absolute steal at $200, if it wasn't for a laundry list of issues with the device. Short battery life due to the absolute power of the hardware and Google's desire to keep the device thin enough. Screens that are usually fantastic (and gorgeous at 1440p with 538 ppi) but sometimes randomly have issues. The notorious microphone issue, which is the reason I had to return my Pixel 2XL (and also the reason I purchased the Pixel 3a XL, I like the product line even for it's issues. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, although my extensive use of the Google ecosystem is definitely a big part of this.) If it wasn't for the microphone issue, I would have kept this phone and probably would have rated it another star higher. Unfortunately, picking up this phone is a roll of the dice with all the hardware faults that could arise (and fairly quickly.)

Pros:
Snappy
the Visual Core chip
Excellent camera
Excellent screen (usually)
higher integration of the Google ecosystem

Cons:
Some of the LCDs on random models have issues
Microphone randomly stops working on some models in certain applications (some people suspect an issue with the audio codec chip)
issues connecting to devices to transfer files

B0C2JJG48D,FRAUD - LOCKED TO VERIZON ONLY!!!!,"Not for the average addicted person who has Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Snapchat, as well as 3 pages of other apps, and hangs on their phone. Perfect for the person who wants to get away from using their smartphone as digital cocaine, hence why some are unsatisfied with this phone's battery life (they're looking for a Galaxy with a 5.5""-6"" expecting Jelly to last all day w/ nonstop use).

Once optimized, I get a solid 13 hours of general use (email, audio, weather, etc.), perfect for exercising (don't even notice it's there), and all the practical uses (""boring"" to mainstream) one might want from a phone, while the small screen makes it comfortable to use briefly, but irritating to use for long periods because you need to focus to operate it (type on it, etc.).

Perfect for anyone who wants to be in touch, informed, educated, but also wants the power of a full smartphone with no compromises in performance while also being forced to use it responsibility, rather than recklessly and addictively. In short, if you use your phone responsibility, you'll be very satisfied. If you're looking for digital cocaine (which many people are), this isn't for you.

There is no other phone like it, and it's exactly what I want.

B085S3CPNK,5G,"All I can say is wow. Cell phones have gotten so expensive and I was not about to fork over $600+ for a sleek phone with an edge screen that would most likely crack on the first drop. All of the carriers are offering aggressive unlimited plans with the ability to BYOD (bring your own device). This phone was a breeze to setup. Pop in the SIM and you are ready to go. I love that the OS is pretty close to base Android and so far the phone has worked great. The battery life is amazing; I consider myself I pretty heavy user and this thing definitely lasts me through the entire day with some left over at night. My only two gripes about the phone is 1.) I'm not 100% sold on the touch navigation setting (using swipes on the finger print scanner button to go back or view recent apps), however this is the only way to have the familiar return-to-home screen tied to the physical button 2.) Although the camera takes nice pictures in daylight, it's no comparison to the clarity of the images that I got with my Samsung Note 4. For the price it can't be beat. Great phone!

B00DTVA7U0,"Amazing phone, one quirk","Oh what to say? Disappointment? I researched this phone a lot. I work in tech. It came down to this or the pixel 2. I prefer small phones and not phablets. I chose essential because it's different, it's a small form factor, the large screen real estate relative to size of phone, and flagship specs. The recent discount was the tipping point. Go with the essential, right?

Who cares it doesn't have an sd card slot, an aux input for audio, or amoled display. This actually looks very good in the sun. Fact it's LCD is ok.

So why 3 stars? Bugs...freaking bugs! How else do you explain after four days of use pretty consistent freezing and lack of touch recognition with very light use? My phone has updated twice since it arrived from amazon last Saturday, Oct. 28. Nothing has improved. I was texting today...texting..and my phone froze for a good 3 seconds while I tried to text a response back. Really? I'm not playing games on this. I'm texting, surfing the web, using gps, pretty much ""essential"" stuff, right?

Imagine this phone in a year, or two years, with these issues. I visited the android forums to find out why. Turns out these are hit and miss issues and certainly they exist for many buyers.

B07RVDCFKM,Value for money,"The battery only lasts 4 hours with ""ANC"" on.
The sound is low quality unless you have ANC on.
With ANC the sound quality is mid 3/5 quality.
This means if you want passable sound quality you are subjected to a 4 hour battery.
The ANC is Low Quality
There is a painful high pitch ringing while using communication apps like zoom, slack or ms teams while ANC is on.
They do not sit comfortably/safely in the ear, and have fallen out multiple times.
The bluetooth functionality is mid/low quality. My audio device settings required constant updates because sound would stop, or not work in all applications if connected to a PC.

B09729J91J,"It's basically a TCL 10 Pro version 2.0, but that's fine","I got this phone and tried to copy all my stuff from the old phone. It took several attempts to finally be able to copy some of it.
One unpleasant surprise - it does not have a notification light for new messages (e-mail, sms, wapp) and missed calls. I tried the so called ""horizon light"" which is useless - it only blinks once when you get a message and then stops. It would be helpful if it blinks or stays on continuously until you check the messages. The lack of a basic visual notification is unexcusable.
Second surprise: it comes with some preinstalled junk you cannot get rid of - Netflix, Youtube etc.
The battery holds OK for days. It lasted over 4 days while using the bluetooth for speaker and headphones, whapp talk/messaging, e-mail (no gaming or video streaming). It charges fast (41% to 93% in 30 mins) albeit a bit slower than advertised.

B0CMZ8ZBVN,"No Scratch, or dings. Only 56 full cycle charges.","I was super nervous 😬 to get a “Refurbished” iPhone. But let me tell you something. The phone looks brand new with no scratches, dents, or scuff marks. I checked the battery cycle and it was only fully charged ~56x. I also checked for the repair history and no parts were replaced according to the iPhone’s history.

This phone does not come with the 1 year warranty from Apple, but considering the money I saved I am ok with that.

Since this is a refurbished phone I received all 3rd party accessories such as iphone box, usb-c cable, usb-c 20w adapter, screen protector.

The only negative I have is the screen protector was made for the 2020 6.1 iphone. As this fits over the screen it does fit the edges of the iPhone 15. This should really come with the proper screen protector.

B016249VHU,Five Stars,"After owning this phone for roughly two months, I can say that without a doubt this phone is everything the average person needs from a smartphone. Even with the 2GB model, it handles any app, any game, and plays video flawlessly. Fingerprint scanner is super-convenient, albeit not 100% accurate. Camera takes great images, even if it does lack proper steady-shot. Video does the job and does not give you blurry footage. Audio quality is great, both in-terms of the speaker and call quality.

A few apps have crashed on me(tumblr, FB), but nothing that I could deem the phone's fault. My RAM usage stays 4-600mbs under the max. I will note that the Facebook app's latest update made it lag to the point of frustration(it has something to do with how they retrieve posts, as once they're loaded the page scrolled fine). I uninstalled the app and just opted to use FB on mobile--zero problems loading on mobile(I use Brave browser, and so should you!). I have no intentions on upgrading to a phone with higher RAM/CPU just to use one of the most notoriously inefficient spyware and bugged-out apps on the market.

The prices of smartphones are ridiculous, only made even more laughable when you have a phone like this that costs 7-8x less and offers a nearly identical experience for all the things that matter (web browsing, video playback, call quality, multi-tasking, quick-charging, dual cameras, gaming, etc.).

B09352C4XY,Fantastic phone at first.,"IMPORTANT UPDATE!! The next day after posting the review below, BOTH PHONES STOPPED MAKING CALLS AGAIN! I am returning them to Amazon, but lose money on the NON-REFUNDABLE TracFone plans. P.S. Be sure to take off auto enroll payments or you’ll keep getting charged.

I bought a new TracFone TCL flip phone 2, set it up, and it wouldn’t make calls right. The phone was only allowing the first call to connect, but not disconnect. The phone became inoperable, forcing me to remove the battery to reset it. I also was getting a “high data usage” message in notifications. I thought it was a lemon, and bought same exact phone again, but it had the same problem. After 4+ days, money out for 2 new phones and prepaid plans, countless hours with customer service and tech support-with no help, I finally figured out how to fix it. Here is a simple 9 step process that fixed the problem... (WARNING: All stored info WILL BE LOST after doing this.)
1.) Power phone on.
2.) Press OK (center circle).
3.) Go to “Settings” and press OK.
4.) Go to #5. “Phone settings” and press OK.
5.) Go to #8. “Reset” and press OK.
6.) Go to #2. “Factory data reset” and press OK
7.) It is on 1. “Phone”, press OK and a WARNING will come up that you are about to reset your phone and lose stored info, press OK again and it will work on resetting the phone by connecting it to the network carrier.
8.) When finished, turn the phone off by pressing and holding the red button above the 3.
9.) Turn it back on by pressing and holding the same button.
Tada…PROBLEM SOLVED! PHONE WORKS GREAT. To make sure it wasn’t a fluke, I did the same 9 steps on the other new, same exact phone, that had the same problems, and now it works perfectly, too! I don’t know why tech support never had me try this, but, all’s well that ends well!
P.S. Being a Prime Member, I could probably send the second phone back, but I think I’ll just keep it. They are good phones at a great price, especially for folks that just want a phone to make calls, like my Dad ; )

B0BQPNMXQV,Top quality audio after a few adjustments,"This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.

I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal. However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent. Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.

After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products. In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.

When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about. However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears. I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box. If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them. Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)

For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds. After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum. I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app. You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB. I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work. I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.

I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams. I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions. However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself. I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit). As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen). What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves. During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume). Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.

And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode. The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene. However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.

As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds. The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see. I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.

use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal however many newer consumerlevel products no longer have audio jacks so i finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that i use i didnt want to spend a lot of money as i didnt foresee myself using this product very much and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones if they were just ok or they broke after a while then i wouldnt feel too bad about the little money that i spent also i wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as i already have an excellent highend bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use and i wouldnt be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone after doing much research i chose the jbl vibe beams as they were at my price point im familiar with jbl products and i could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that ive come to expect from jbl products in my research i read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass so i was a bit concerned when i received and started listening to my jbl vibe beams i understood what people were talking about however to correct the issues first one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears im fortunate in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the vibe beams they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box if you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips or try tips from one of your other wellfitting earbuds if you have them once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear that took care of the poor bass issue i have not worn them longterm so i cant speak to them falling out of my ear as others have mentioned but they seem to stay in pretty well for the misaligned frequency response issue fortunately the jbl headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a tenband graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds after listening to several of the reference tracks i use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against i found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum ive included a screenshot of my eq curve which i based on the bass preset in the jbl app you cant tell as there is no db scale on the side but i needed to cut or boost by only db i find that my new eq curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that i use for my audio mixing and mastering work i invite you to use my eq curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you i also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the vibe beams i connected the jbls to several different sources phone computer tv mp player etc and i found that the overall maximum volume with limiter off is relatively lower than wired speaker versions however the input to the jbls is relative to the maximum output of the source itself i found that the loudest level i could get came from my iphone and the lowest level output came from my mp player which probably doesnt offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit as a comparison i did a sidebyside test of the jbls with my wifes airpods nd gen what i found was that the jbls offered an almost identical audio output level as the airpods with any of the sources i used so that confirmed that the output level of the jbls has more to do with the source and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs than with the earbuds themselves during my test i put the jbls at their maximum volume output one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume also i noticed during my testing that the airpods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video but the jbls excelled at fullrange sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and wellsuited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies and speaking of movies the jbl app has a switchable audiovideo mode the video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture so there isnt a noticeable lipsync issue with dialogue in a scene however there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of video mode versus audio mode but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you as a side note i included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds the l and r designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves so

B092W97PKH,Lightweight but very touchy and pain in the butt,"Pros:
Laptop has a very fast start time due to solid state drive

Runs every game I play on the highest settings

Well lit and comfortable keyboard

Beautiful screen

For a gaming laptop the battery life is acceptable, around 4-5 hours when doing schoolwork.

Able to change keyboard color

Feels sturdy with an aluminum body.

Lightweight.

Cons:
I have read that, though the video card is capable of running VR; their are some complications in running VR. I have not tried this myself, but it is something you might want to research before buying.

The speakers are a bit more quiet than I would prefer them to be. I use a headset when gaming so it is hardly an issue.

The fans are pretty loud on the highest setting, however I rarely need to have them on this setting.

B0B56763LF,works good,These earphones with neckband are the way to go if you need amazing battery life! I have not used them everyday but I’ve had them since April 24 and used them off and on for couple of days and left them turned off when I didn’t need them maybe a week or two and I just barely hit around 50% charge on them. I can’t compare them to true noise canceling earphones but they work for me to make calls on haven’t had a complaint about being able to be heard while walking through stores. I have some different brand short battery life that play music loud on lowest volume setting. These don’t play as loud but still pretty good for the quality of battery life. I’m sure if I used them more consistently the battery life would be a little shorter. However some I have don’t hold charge well when they are turned off these do.

B0BYPGGDZX,mid overpriced earbuds,"I was pleasantly surprised with these little guys. They are comfortable to wear and for the most part stay in place. I didn't have any problems with them popping out while jogging or even indoor rock climbing. They did, however, start to fall out while doing a few yoga poses and stretches where your ear goes to the ground, but I don't think any earbuds that don't wrap around your earlobe would prevent that.

Sound quality is pretty good and I haven't had issues with hearing, or being heard, via phone calls. The range is also pretty good. I didn't test exactly how far I separate the ear buds from the phone, but you can definitely walk to another room without it cutting out.

I've never tried Apple Airpods or any other pricey brands in this style of earbuds, so maybe those others are far superior. But these work great for me and do everything I would expect them too.

B006ULGWPK,Bummed,"This is a fantastic phone for a teenager, inexpensive and robust. It's hard to damage these phones, as they have a plastic casing with a rubbery sort of grip.

There are two major caveats that folks might care about:

The first is that this is the 3G only version of this phone. If using AT&T or T-Mobile, you'll be restricted to their HSPA+ networks (AKA, H+), which, while fast is not a true 4G.

The second is that with the recent update to the game, this phone is now unable to play Pokemon Go, as it does not have 2GB of RAM.

B07NWR7QYP,Ease,"First since amazon lists reviews together with other products ill tell you I bought the Samsung Galaxy A50 US Version Factory Unlocked Cell Phone with 64GB Memory, 6.4"" Screen, Black, [SM-A505UZKNXAA].

With that being said I have seen some reviews that it doesn't work with US Verizon, I mean the first review I read was that it didn't work. I'm not sure if they just didn't read something properly or bought the wrong version but in the US with Verizon it works for me. No problems what so ever.

Now when I went through the comments on posts about the phone I saw someone list the instructions for the phone to work with Verizon. I went ahead and followed them and it worked perfect. You might not even have to follow them but i'll list them anyways
1) DO NOT insert SIM or memory card.
2)DO NOT associate gmail account.
3) DO all the updates first.
4)Set up gmail account (optional).
5) Insert the SIM and transfer data via best method.

As for the phone, its great so far. You can not beat it for the price. Its a beast. No regrets.

Don't let the reviews scare you, they almost got to me but just stay calm, pick the right version and you'll SHOULD be good.

B016K32STG,Five Stars,"I bought this phone with the intention of it being a multi use device. Aside from the obvious - it being a smart phone - I wanted to have a place to store my music, and my ebooks. With a 128g additional storage capacity, I think I've got what I was after with this phone.
The phone is big and an upgrade from the S3 mini I had been using. Reading books on this is not as monotonous as I would have thought. The screen size for reading (in my opinion) is just on the ample side and not too small. The phone fits in my cargo pocket at work, without beating my leg up when I walk.
I am not the kind of consumer that needs to have the latest and greatest gadget. I can usually make due with something comparable and a couple generations old. I spent a little more on the S5 than I normally would on any phone, but could justify it knowing it would be basically a 3 in 1 device.
I read reviews and watched a ton of videos on youtube about this phones capabilities. I won't get into those here because they are stil there (online) and free to all. I may never fully unlock the potential of this phone to warrant putting any of my own videos online, but for my needs - it's good.
Some people are hard on their devices and turn around and blame the manufacturers for any 'shortcomings'. One small detail needs to be pointed out: the charging cover on this phone is flimsy and would be REAL easy to get broken off. Two things - 1: WHENEVER you unplug the charger, the phone prompts you to CLOSE THE COVER as a courtesy reminder. 2: A simple conscious effort on the part of the owner can also alleviate this from happening. If you break the cover off - it's most likely all on you.

B0BVGRRQRH,the phone is not charging,"So I've had the galaxy buds and galaxy buds+ and decided to give these a try. When I opened the case for the first time I was shocked at how tiny they are and they hide in the ear very very well.

I needed something that didn't seal in the ear so when I'm at work I can still hear what's going on around me. The ""ambient"" noise on other buds including Samsung's weren't really enough. These are perfect for that. This is one of the main reasons I bought them. Why they added ANC to these I will never know but it doesn't block any sound to me as these weren't really designed to block a lot of sound so I always have ANC turned off.

The fitment is good and they don't move around. Sound can greatly depend on where you place them in the ear surprisingly so getting them just right takes a few tries in the beginning and then it comes natural on the placement. I do experience ear fatigue that starts to get painful after awhile. Samsung's are the only ear bud I've had an issue with ear fatigue on even with the buds and buds+. I've been using these for a few weeks now and I'm hoping my ears will get used to them eventually where I won't experience any.

As far as sound quality goes, I run these on dynamic. I also turn the pressure setting on to relieve pressure and it seems to change the sound up a bit. These by far have more bass than the buds and buds+ combined BUT it's not a lot of bass. It's just enough that I'm satisfied with them. The downside I think to the additional bass is lost clarity. They don't seem as clear as the buds/buds+ and I've experimented with different placement positions in the ear and it hasn't helped much and dynamic to me is the best EQ setting to still get the type of sound I'm looking for.

From what other people have told me the call quality is good. Not the clearest but not the worst. Every now and then I'll have to repeat my self when talking. Everyone has said these do a great job of blocking out background noises from my work as other buds that I own seem to amplify background noises.

The battery life to me is great. I use them for a few hours at a time and they've been great with the battery. I usually charge them one to two times a week.

Overall I'm very satisfied with these. They were exactly what I was looking for when it came to having wireless ear buds for work. There could be a few small improvements made but I do really like them. The touch pad doesnt always recognize what I'm wanting especially on the right ear bud.

B00J4TK4JU,love my new phone and it works great overseas,"I purchased this device half a year ago. It worked fine for a month then the screen died. No drops or water damage at all. I figured this to be a factory defect so i contacted Samsung to try and get repairs made so i could get it to work again. They needed the original purchase order with the phone id to make sure i wasn't trying to cheat the warenty. I contacted Supreme Deals and asked them for the necessary paperwork. They had been hit by a hurricane and asked for some patience, i obliged. After hearing nothing from them for a week and a half i contacted them back, they said they would have it all back by the end of the week. A week passes and still no invoice. i have to go back and forth with them 3 more times before i finally got the invoice i needed to repair the phone.

So i finally send it in to Samsung and they tell me two things 1. that it is beyond repair (the LCD screen broke and it was worth more than the phone was) and 2. it had been tampered with by a non authorized (or not a Samsung worker) before. Now seeing as i bought this device as New this was unexpected and obviously not what I paid for. I contact Supreme Deals to let them know and ask for a refund or replacement. They said that Samsung was incorrect about their own product and that the only thing was the guy who unlocked the phone. The phone i purchased was not even an unlocked device. They then promptly told me i was past the 30 day return policy and they would not stand buy their product.

I tried many times and still they would not refund me for their faulty product. As i am a poor college kid who is now suddenly out $280 dollars and a functioning phone i want to simply warn others away from a seemingly trustworthy company to find that they are not ones to take care of their customers.

B01MXLZIDS,Mediocre value phone,"Bought this as an upgrade from the Motorola Optimo Maxx.
So far everything has been good. Was able to upgrade this phone from Android 10 to 11 whereas the Optimo Maxx was stuck on 10.
I really like this phone (and a fan of Motorola's) however I haven't really noticed yet leaps and bounds difference from the Optimo Maxx.
I mainly use my phone's for browsing the web, checking email, and listening to music so I haven't really pushed the phone's limits.

B07N4M4K3Q,Was definitely everything promised.,"I have been testing foldable phones lately and the biggest issue is when you look at samsung they load all of their custom apps and software phone vs the google pixel series always has a simple version of android with the latest of everything from google. The screen size when closed with this phone is pretty good over all but it feels too short. When you open the phone it is pretty awesome but google completed failed at allowing you to have options when the unit is open. For example if you open gmail on the pixel fold you are forced to have the email list on the left and to view the email on the right, there is no way to view it as big large screen. On the samsung fold and oneplus open you can view then full. If you opened a PDF in gmail it only uses half of the screen, It is the dumbest implementation I have seen. The phone feels really heavy compared to the other foldables and feels unfinished in so many ways. The software is not what I expect from Google compared to something like the Pixel 8 Pro. While you get many of the features google is known for its still not complete. I could not see my self using this as a daily phone after testing out other foldables.

B00DFVXBRU,good laughs,"The Samsung S32BM80 monitor is quite a thing of beauty to behold. The white 32"" monitor case and bezel and white stand are very European in their design. Functionally, I find this monitor unduly complicated and the instructions available leave a lot to be desired.

The monitor comes very well-packaged in plenty of protective styrofoam and foam wrapping in its own cardboard box. Included with the monitor are a number of pieces: a two-part white steel stand, webcam, remote control, HDMI to mini-HDMI cable, USB-C cable, a power adapter and AC cord, as well as quick setup guide and warranty information.

Given the cost of this monitor plus its complexity, the included instructions were sorely lacking. The Quick Setup Guide font and pictographs were difficult to read and follow. Fortunately, I went online to the Samsung website and was able to locate and download a User Manual as well as monitor driver software and instructions for firmware updates. This software driver installation should be done before installing the monitor. Nowhere in the enclosed instructions is all this spelled out. Unfortunately, the complete user guide isn't much more helpful either.

The Samsung monitor can be connected to a PC by the enclosed HDMI to mini-HDMI cable or by USB-C cable. I used the HDMI cable after loading the driver and had no problems. The monitor then connects to your home network by WiFi. This occurred easily and quickly.

The monitor updated its software once connected. The WiFi connection enables the monitor to act as a SmartHub for household IoTs and as a smart TV in addition to a monitor. It operates on Samsung TV Plus operating system, which is similar to Google TV or Roku interface. There are any number of both free and premium paid apps on the Samsung TV Plus system; however, a Samsung account is required by the system. One hassle is that as a monitor, everything is controlled by your computer keyboard and mouse. As the Smart Monitor/TV, everything is controlled by the rechargeable remote control. You should, therefore, keep the remote close at hand. It's very small, so do not misplace it!

The 4K display is very nice. Colors are vibrant and appear realistic. This monitor is a step up for me from a 1080p monitor of similar size and the 4K display is a big plus. The preset audio volume from built-in side-firing speakers is very low, but can be adjusted. The sound is crisp and dialogue is clear. I ended up adding external speakers to improve the sound volume while in monitor mode.

Some gripes I have with this monitor: it is quite a complex piece of equipment and I have yet to figure out all it is capable of. The Smart Monitor recognizes the attached web camera and can open a window; however, I cannot get my Windows 10 PC nor any computer software to recognize the same camera. The same thing goes for the built-in microphone. I cannot find any help in identifying a fix for this. As a result, I now have two cameras atop the monitor plus an extra set of speakers.

B08J5G9JCN,Was I sold a stolen phone?,"For $150 this is a great phone, the battery life is great and the speed seems surprisingly good for a budget phone. People complain about the screen resolution, but hardly noticiable for most uses. The only complaint I would have is that the ""double tap"" to wake the screen feature works about half the time. With it being an international phone its default is in Spanish, kind of unusual.

B09V12VJ21,Awesome for price,"The Hexa is currently the best hybrid I’ve heard under $300. That really should be the end of this review, but anyway if you’re still reading:

Build quality is surprisingly top-notch, with a 3D printed resin very similar to my Moondrop Variations. The metal faceplates don’t at all seem like a weak point. These are deceptively small IEMs, even lower profile than the 7Hz Zero for example with basically the same nozzle width. Not a fan of the cable due to the stiff ear hooks, but it’s of course replaceable.

The tone is warm-neutral, with the dynamic driver occasionally flexing its stuff when really low frequencies are called for but mostly staying back in the mix. I.e., not an IEM for bass lovers. Further, the dynamic driver seems to be highly damped, giving a “dry” character or fast decay not dissimilar to balanced armature bass. The attack is not great, but not bad for a budget hybrid by any means.

Imaging is price class-leading, having only a little difficulty separating instruments in the mix and placing them with above-average accuracy. Some passages with loud bass in the background, e.g. poorly mixed soundtracks or EDM, can give this set some trouble. Note that my benchmarks are stuff like the Variations or S8 which are nearly 10 times the price so not an even comparison.

“Worth the money” is always a subjective phrase, but this is about as close to an ‘objectively good’ purchase as you can get in the sub $100 category.",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2023",Lois,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09V12VJ21/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_5?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=5,"SoundPEATS Free2 Classic Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth V5.1 Headphones with 30Hrs Playtime in-Ear Wireless Earphones, Built-in Mic for Clear Calls, Touch Control, Single/Twin Mode, Stereo Sound",Visit the SoundPEATS Store,4.3 out of 5 stars,"About this item[Ingenious Design and Relaxing Fit] The earbud contains laser-engraved leather texture and has ergonomic design blended with metal elements which maintains balance between elegance and relaxation.

B07N91S9MW,Almost Perfect,"Several gripes: The battery life is poor. Barely gets through the day. It charges insanely fast, but still, the battery life is a serious disappointment.

Another gripe is when the phone updates, it messes up the screen / app layout. Just when you get everything laid out nice...

Camera and video is very good.

In summary, battery life is a deal killer. The phone itself is overkill to a large degree factoring in the price.

B0C3NV42GJ,"Great ANC, case, call quality. Returned for ear pain.","If you like your MTW2 as much as I do, the question you're probably asking yourself is ""should I upgrade to the MTW3?"" I did and I have some mixed feelings after the first few days of using the MTW3. My first observation is that it's an incremental upgrade. The 3 is better than the 2 in most respects but the improvement is not earth shaking. It's incremental. The sound is a little different, if not better, and the ANC is improved if you can get a proper seal with one of the provided eartips. The new shape may or may not improve your comfort level. Personally, I find the sound to be brighter but at the same time the bass is improved too. The overall response is good, and I don't apply any EQ. The sound is very clean and crisp much like the Sony XM4 but fuller with a little better bottom end.

The fit is another matter. For me, the MTW3 is okay but not as comfortable as the MTW2, but by only a small margin. However, to achieve that comfort level with the MTW2, I use Spinfit CP360 eartips. The factory eartips are okay but I get a better seal with the Spinfit eartips and they are more comfortable. The MTW3 has a larger nozzle so the CP360 tips do not fit. The CP145 tips fit the larger nozzle but the eartip specs differ from the CP360 so it doesn't feel as comfortable in my ears. That said, the CP145 is still more comfortable than the factory tips and I can get a better seal which improves the sound quality of the MTW3.

I've been using the MTW3 for a couple of weeks now. Initially, I would have said that if you already have the MTW2 it's not worth $250 to upgrade to the 3. My feeling now is that I'm glad I upgraded. I'm not sure if it's because of a burn-in period but the MTW3 sounds better today than it did when I first got it. The apt-X codec is a must for the best sound.

Update: The Spinfit CP1025 eartips will fit the MTW3. I find them to be the best fit and most comfortable in my ears. Sound isolation is very good and that improves the sound quality and ANC.

Update 2: After 5 months of use, the right earbud went bad. Now, I can't use ""transparency mode"" if ANC is on. If I do, the right earbud produces a low-pitched rumble loud enough to obscure the music. It was easy to go online and get return authorization but I'm responsible for shipping cost to Sennheiser. They cover return shipping cost. I'll provide an update when I get the earbuds back from Sennheiser.

Update 3: Sennheiser replaced the defective pair that I returned to them with a brand new, sealed box. Total down time from the date I shipped it to them to the date I received the replacement pair was 13 days. I'm very pleased with the Sennheiser support service and I really couldn't ask for more. I charged up the new pair and updated the firmware. They sound great and I'm good to go once more.",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2022",Darcy G.,Verified Purchase,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C3NV42GJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3,"JBL Tour Pro 2 - True wireless Noise Cancelling earbuds with Smart Charging Case, 6-mic perfect calls with voice control, Up to 40hrs of playtime, Immersive Spatial Sound (Black)",Visit the JBL Store,4.2 out of 5 stars,"About this itemSmart Case for seamless experience: Control the earbuds' settings, manage calls and playback, control your audio setting and battery level and set your alarm without taking out your phone, through the screen of the charging case.

It's not as powerful as I somewhat expected, but maybe I haven't customized to the right sound enhancements as yet, but apart from that, I recommend these earbuds especially for persons on a budget, but still wants good quality, the ear hooks makes it even more convenient for those who have trouble keeping regular earbuds in their ears.

B01GSOS364,"Great phone, but I wouldn't buy from this seller ...","I got this phone because I wanted a large screen and a stylus. I used it a lot and enjoyed it for the first couple weeks.
Then it slowed down. Lots of delays in processing apps and system functions. The screen size is amazing and the stylus works wonderful. It is a bit flimsy and I broke the top off after 3 weeks, but I am harder on stuff than some people.
I feel that the battery life was well above average. I charge regularly and it only sucked a lot of power while playing games or using multiple apps at the same time. That would normally be Pandora and Chrome.

However, the internal storage on this phone is abysmal if you want to install many games. It only has 8GB of storage and items will not install directly to the microSD card. You can transfer, but still have to have the memory to install in the first place. This phone is large enough and the resolution is nice enough to play very good games, but I cannot install them. To transfer an app to the microSD card requires you to have at least the same amount of internal memory free as the app's size. It has to duplicate itself, then transfer to external memory, then still keep a portion on the internal storage.
Not many Virgin Mobile phones have internal memory above 8GB either.

I cannot recommend this phone, unless you don't need a lot of storage and just want to use it as a phone, internet browser and media streaming device.

B0BZ9T8R41,Excelente,"Tracfone was able to migrate my 3G LG flip-cellphone to this Alcatel 4G/LTE flip-cellphone. Tracfone patiently received my request for cellphone activation, where they completed the request in a few hours. I only use the flip-cellphone to make calls and receive texts on rare occasions, so I turned-off all other apps on the flip-cellphone to keep from wasting purchased Tracfone ""data"" units for frivolous activities. Also, I created a contact on the flip-cellphone called Customer Service with the cellphone number 611611. Then, I texted 611611 the word Balance to verify my balance and renewal date updated to the new flip-cellphone. In addition, you have an option of storing contacts on the SIM card or on the device and I chose to store them on the device, since I doubt if my 4G SIM card will fit in an upgraded 5G, 6G, etc., cellphone in the future.

This Alcatel 4G/LTE cellphone could connect by Wi-FI to my 2.5 Ghz cable modem, but it did not see my 5.0 Ghz cable modem Wi-Fi broadcast. We tested the Alcatel 4G/LTE flip-cellphone and it will automatically switch from using my Wi-Fi cable modem to using 4G/LTE when traveling outside the range of the Wi-Fi cable modem, which is approximately 100 feet. -- I like the Alcatel 4G/LTE cellphone.

B0B92ZFQ6D,Stopped Working After 3 Months,"It's been almost a year since I purchased these earbuds - and I am pleased to say that they have exceeded my expectations! They are very good at noise canceling and have amazing sound quality. They stay in my ears well (although it did take a few experimental uses to find out which size best fit my ears). Once I did find the right size, the earbuds never ever come out and do not hurt at all, even after 2+ hours. The app that comes with the earbuds is also very helpful and well-made. Bluetooth is easy to connect to after setting everything up. However, my absolute favorite part is the battery life; it lasts you so so long!

B08R6MQ7BQ,Very sex.,"I have a one plus 6t, it has a great feature - a drawer for holding widgets. They removed that, totally gone. Now when you slide to the left you get google news, with no solid way of removing it and if you do disable it, there is no left pane. There is a widget shelf of sorts but it only holds 6 things and only useless apps. So now you have to use more screen space for widgets. And the widget sizes are limited so they have to be very big or very small.

The phone is plenty fast, but they dumbed it down. Before I could long press an icon, see its widget and install. Now you can't. Before you could long press the widget and reset it or restart it, now you can't. Before you could use an index to find stuff in long lists, now you can't.

The camera, dumb. It has 2 modes - 12mp, 50mp. Nothing in between. So its either a 4mb file or a 20mb file, with no say 20mp in the middle. There are 3 lenses - no zoom. A wide angle, a normal and a 2x, its not a zoom, its just another lens. And when you get too close to something it switches to macro. Which is fine, but macro is a different lens, and so the viewpoint changes with it. Its like when you hold your finger in front of your face and open and close each eye and it jumps around.

Its also hard to hold horizontally because they stupidly put the lens right where your finger goes.

Beyond that its a good phone, it could really use a camera software update and I really want my widget shelf back. Oh and do get a case, this thing is super hard to hold. The edges are active and you constantly press stuff. Its hard to hold and your hand migrates to the old part of the phone with grip and that's the camera lens. The black phone feels like plastic and doesn't give you grip.

B079Z9P4LD,"Great deal, looks and feels expensive!","Ok, where do I start? A little background first I suppose so you know where I stand. I've been a Blackberry fan since the Curve days but we have a Samsung Galaxy 5, an Iphone 5, an Ipad and a Blackberry Playbook in the house. I have used Android as a daily driver before but I've always preferred the simplicity and business mindedness of the Blackberry ecosystem. I moved from a Z10 before this purchase. I'm not a media hound on a phone (I can watch movies, view DirectTV, etc. on the Ipad, although you can certainly do all this with the Passport). My profession involves reading a lot of large format documents like PDFs, CAD files, GIS documents, etc. and I wanted something where I wasn't constantly scrolling around and zooming in and out. The Passport seemed the perfect blend between laptop and smartphone where I might be able to do all of this.

So for the review. Initial impressions are, this thing is an absolute beast. When you open the box, the first thing that comes to mind is, oh man, how am I going to carry this around with me? After a day or two with it though, that feeling quickly disappears and, if you're migrating from a smaller device like a standard iphone or previous Blackberry model, you'll wonder how you ever got along without the wide format. As others have said, the build quality is unparalleled. There's no cheap plastic, it has a solid feel, if not a little heavy, and I am confident (although I'd never do it, ha) that I could skip it across a parking lot and it would come up a little bruised but work perfectly fine. Blackberry hasn't had a premium feel phone like this since the 9900 series but if you picture a mega sized version of that, a 9900 on steroids, if you will, you'll get the idea. In short, it fits into the front pocket of a normal fitting pair of pants perfectly fine.

You can read all of the other reviews about the merits of BB10 so I won't go into detail about that ecosystem too much, just some of the functionality. Echoing most opinions is that the hub is bar none the most genius thing about the phone and I haven't found anything in it that I look for that isn't there. It is extremely well thought out and much deserved of the glowing reviews it's gotten. I'm constantly having little friendly `one up' debates with the other phone users in our house. Can your phone do that, kind of stuff like, can you move files back and forth on the fly? Or the seamless out of the box streaming opportunities with your home network, or the `let me check my calendar' kind of stuff, while then editing the calendar and e-mailing an invite, all while on a phone call. I think I'll check the weather too while I'm at it... My point is that this is a multi-tasking business phone through and through and if you approach it with that mind-set, you won't be disappointed. That said, it handles media files perfectly well too and allows you to use it for fun when you want. I've read several reviews which indicate that because it's a square phone, the biggest detractor is that videos can't be shown in 16:9. Not true. The format is only slightly, and I mean barely noticeable slightly smaller than my Z10 (1/4""?) was and if you lay my son's iphone over it, it produces an image of just about the same size. It's just that you have black bars above and below your video, because the screen isn't 16:9 shaped. Really not a big deal at all.

Everyone wants to know about typing. I sorely missed leaving a full QWERTY for a glass touch in the Z10. While I got used to touch, I still got annoyed with it and sometimes, you just don't bother responding to someone like you used to because the proofreading becomes maddening. Make no mistake, there is a huge learning curve with this keyboard. Not so much the typing as you can master that in a day, but with the 4th (virtual) row. A real QWERTY layout has all of the punctuation marks on the bottom. The virtual row is of course, at the top which is really disconcerting at first. I've had the phone for a few days now and I'm slowly getting used to it but I have no doubt that I'll master the change. Make no mistake though, it is weird. The keyboard capacitive sensing touch feature is pure genius and it makes scrolling through web pages a dream. Very mouse on desktop computer like where the display moves around without you needing to drag your finger directly over it.

Apps? I have found that there are very few apps that don't work and those that have a problem almost always require a Google account to function. Things like Strava which constantly needs Google Services to talk to the mother ship for example. No thanks, I'll find an alternative. I'm not sure what other phone allows you to tap into its native app world and competing app worlds like the Google Play Store and Amazon at the same time. This is one of its biggest selling points as far as I'm concerned. All of the major apps are available and the phone comes with some of those already baked in all while integrated into its messaging system. Facebook, Twitter, Linked in, Dropbox, Box, etc. etc. are all there. What's great is that file sharing is already linked up with all of those accounts too. Just hit share, select which service you want the file to go to and, voila. Dropbox and Box even allow you to automatically upload pics and videos on the fly when they're recorded. Instant cloud storage, if that's your thing. I use this all the time to send large data files back and forth to clients.

All of the things that other reviewers have said are absolutely true. Big, beautiful display, lightning fast OS, huge battery life (easily gets a day and a half of heavy use. My z10 was awful in this regard), and a communication powerhouse. Camera is the best out of any BB I've owned and I would rate it on par with my son's iPhone. I am so happy with this thing that it isn't even funny.

Lastly, and I could care less what people think, but it is worth mentioning that your day will be tied up in an inadvertent sales pitch when you pull this beast out during a meeting or at a coffee shop. You will find that people will be caught between surprise, bewilderment, and laughter because it is so different. In the end, they will all ask what it is and where it came from. And, while it is not for everyone as should be plain to see, it has left many impressed.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2014",Marco Avina,Verified

going to carry this around with me after a day or two with it though that feeling quickly disappears and if youre migrating from a smaller device like a standard iphone or previous blackberry model

while im at it my point is that this is a multitasking business phone through and through and if you approach it with that mindset you wont be disappointed that said it handles media files perfectly well too and allows you to use it for fun when you want ive read several reviews which indicate that because its a square phone the biggest detractor is that videos cant be shown in not true the

B00J3554KE,My boyfriend have same phone with att and works perfect. This phone come with all the att apps ...,"I upgraded my phone XZ PREMIUM to 5 II. It was not a good idea. Switching from 5.5 inches/16:9 ratio to 6.1 inches/21:9 ratio display was disappointing for me. It's much narrower than I thought. Watching the movies and YouTube on XZ PREMIUM is more comfortable. Although this old flagship model still works fine, Sony does not support OS update after two years since release date. Also, I like using Sony apps. 5 II doesn't have ""Album"" and other Sony apps. I felt the phone has lost ""Originality."" I have been using Xperia for a long time. I never like to use Google Photos because it doesn't work great as a photo editor. So, it's frustrating.

It could be a time to find a reasonable 5G phone which will work on AT&T 5G+ network when it comes to my area. Overall, it was upgrading my phone, but I didn't really feel that way.

B07G9XZ83W,Versatile,"This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW! If you’ve only had LCD TVs in the past, the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image. My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldn’t be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room I’ve found it’s plenty bright enough, and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before (Vizio M658-G1). LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports for 4k/120Hz Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, ALLM, etc. I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing! I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k! Everything I’ve watched on it looks better than ever before and I can’t say enough good things about it. After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options:
- Compared to the LG G3: A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity. The G3 is noticeably brighter but, like I said, I haven’t felt like the C3 wasn’t bright enough and it was brighter than I expected
- Compared to the Samsung S95C: Again, much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner, especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV. The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues, poor firmware updates, and no Dolby Vision HDR support
- Compared to LG C2: The C3 is very similar to the C2 and it’s hard to justify the price increase of the C3. It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more. The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20,000 zones instead of 5,000 and is a little bit brighter. It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2. A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes. That issue was fixed on the 2023 models. Lastly, the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu that’s nice for changing settings in a snap
- Compared to Samsung S90C: This is the C3’s biggest competition this year because they are close in price. The S90C has the better QD-OLED panel and is brighter and more colorful. I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C. I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come. Also, QD-OLED appears to have more risk of burn-in and I like to keep my TVs for a long time
- Compared to Samsung S95B (2022 model): I wanted a 77” TV and the S95B only comes in 55” and 65”. Also, Samsung issues I mentioned before

Conclusion: The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people. Everything I’ve watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED. They’ve been making them longer than anyone else and they’ve figured out how to prevent burn-in for the vast majority of users. If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isn’t for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies, TV shows, gaming, etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy.

B08JCWLB3B,It is great,"Purchased this phone to upgrade from a Moto G6 that I had for about 2 years.

Have had 0 freezes or reboots or anything of the sort (aside from security updates that require them)

The phone is pretty big, definitely the biggest I've ever owned. I don't mind the size in my pocket (even with a wallet case that is pretty thick itself) and it is pretty easy to shoulder hold the phone while talking which I found difficult with smaller phones.

The screen is clear and responsive, it gets bright enough to use in bright light although its not great in direct sunlight. I've watched twitch and youtube on it and it looks great. The bezels are pretty small compared to my G6 I had previously. The screen is flat enough to use a screen protector without the sides bubbling up.

The front camera is standard fare. I don't use it much. The rear cameras are pretty good. The nightvision is pretty silly but the slow mo video and macro lens work as advertised. Does it take pictures like my DSLR? No. But I would never use any phone to do a real cameras job.

The phone itself runs fast and has a pretty huge amount of storage. I added a 512gb SD card and can carry almost 1TB in my pocket. Amazing. I don't really use the phone to its full capabilities, I used the stylus once and it was too laggy after using a drawing tablet for my computer for a few years. I don't game on the phone so can't really comment as to that.

I do enjoy the moto ""gestures"" or whatever they're called. If you do a double karate chop with the phone the flashlight turns on. If you twist the phone twice the camera turns on. Works when the lockscreen is up so you can get a flashlight easily when needed.

The best part about this phone, however, is the battery. I get a FULL 4 days between charges with ~5-10% remaining when I plug it in. I typically text throughout the day and have 1-2 phone calls totaling 60 minutes of talk time per day. And the phone last for 4 days. I've never had a phone battery last more than 2 days, even purchasing some that advertised long battery life. For that alone this was totally worth the purchase.

Currently on total wireless this phone was the best deal I found for what I wanted. It has pretty high end specs for an ultra budget (~$100-$150) Android phone. It should keep getting security updates through Motorola for a while.

B093DXMSZB,excellent condition,"We live a hard life in the boonies of northern Alaska and a Sat phone is a must have especially in the winter time when it can get to -80 degrees and you are relying almost completely on your vehicle and the small amount of gear you can carry. We purchased this phone as soon as it was available on the market so it has seen a few years of use. The size is very good and is easy to carry on your person without too much discomfort. It will work in very cold weather as long as you pack it insulated or near your body. In winter we store it on our person under our gear in a soft waterproof case, in the warm months we store it in our back pack in a waterproof and shatterproof case. The battery lasts a very long time and we never had problems with it though after a few years it holds a charge for less time then it did new, we are finally buying a replacement now. Extra batteries are fairly cheap at about 25$ a pop. Don't lose the charger plug in as they can cost over a hundred bucks. We also charge the phone on our goal zero solar power set up when we are out and it works great. It is very important that you understand and have reliable phone service basics besides the phone itself, and it's pretty much your choice like regular phone services. We found a company out of Florida that are amazing and very helpful. We re-charge our minutes every six months for around $250, which gives us enough minutes to use for check ins and for emergencies. The service also lets us make emergency calls even without minutes which is awesome. You can also send text messages to this phone via the internet which has been very helpful. It's easy to use and is intuitively set up, but you will need to read the owners manual. We did have a person use the phone and then for some reason tried to twist the antennae to store it. It cost us a pretty penny to have it fixed, but tons less then buying another phone. The antennae is the only weak spot we can see in the design of this phone.

B07GNHBRKT,fotos y videos,"Upon receiving the phone I was highly impressed with the packaging and the design of the phone itself. I have been using the phone for a few days now and I must say the phone is very quick and snappy. The sound from the speakers is very crisp and clear as well. The phone is just the right size and feels great in the hands. I must say the OS design and layout definitely had a lot of thought and design put in them. The cameras are clear as crisp as well and the fingerprint scanner is very quick to unlock the phone.

However with the good does also come the bad. I have been using the phone for about 4-5 days now and have noticed the phone does get quite warm quite quick when streaming video or playing games. I removed the phone from the case to clean it and upon removing from the case I noticed some marks on the back of the phone which look like scratches which would be odd as the phone has been in a case since the day it was purchased. Upon looking into this further I notice a bulge on the back of the phone around where the said marks are appearing. I am not sure if this a design flaw or from the phone getting to hot. I will be reaching out to Nextbit support to see what can be done about this.

Nextbit was extremely helpful in getting a replacement sent, and live chat was pleasant. Its definitely nice to see a company very open to their customers feedback.

B0BTTVBDVD,Picture and feature quality.,"Beautifully performing TV. Wish it came with a paper 'Getting Started' manual. I used Google and my cell phone to complete setup. I will update later on the Sound Bar.

Update: Samsung Neo QLED QN90C. The resolution is beautiful and amazing compared to my former Samsung 1080P. However there are some frustrations, that had I have known, my purchase would have not been a sure thing.
1. Samsung touts the level of black supported, unfortunately when a black(or darker) image is displayed there is often a loss of image detail.
2. When a bright/white scene or image is displayed, it is very bright and impressive. However, most images displayed do not fit into that category and the overall image character or quality is darker than that of my former 1080P.
3. The Samsung Sound Bar (HW-Q700C) included with the TV is not what I expected. At normal listening levels, such as TV programming, the system still has the muffled quality of my former TV. To enjoy high quality sound you must significantly raise the sound level or rotate the sound bar so that the up facing speakers face outward toward the audience.

B09V6GHWDJ,I love all 75 inches,"Hands down. This 65 inch S95C OLED has the best picture I have ever seen. For that alone, I would still purchase the S95C again. However, all the reviews from Samsung customers about very poor functioning softwear/firmware are all true. Each time you turn on the TV you have to navigate through Samsung software (Picture 1) or wait a minute and it will default to your last station. I tried attaching a local indoor digital antenna, but the softwear makes it almost inpossible to find or install. After hours or reading comments from other Samsung customers about the problem online I finally got it activated in the software only to find it's lost again. Samsung TV drags you way from other subscription channel programming and you can only use the non-illiminated Samsung remote which is horrible to work with (especially at night or dim light) to take several steps to get back. I have Direct TV on 4 other Samsung TVs of different models and this is the only one that looses the live stream of DTV and of Netflix. The TVs computer is a separate box that needs to be mounted separately on a wall, table or mounting holes on the back of the TV which some may like and some may not. Did not use for gaming.

B08YQ3GCL2,Cómodos,"MEElectronics has made a fantastic product, backed by a great warranty, with easily replaceable parts due to modular construction, and fantastic customer service to right any wrongs and answer questions. Truth told, though I would probably give the product itself a 4 or a 4.5, but its the customer service provided by the company that bumps these headphones up to a 5 star rating.

Bottom Line
- Buy them. For $50 you're getting a great sounding set of headphones that will last you a long time, with parts that are easy to replace so that they last you an even longer time (and keep some electronics out of the landfill), plus it is obvious that MEElectronics stands behind their product with great customer service and a fantastic lifetime replacement program.

- Be aware that they take a little getting used to, and finding a proper fit is important to enjoying these headphones.

- The volume control is a slider, not buttons. Just something to be aware of if you have a preference.

-I find that the plain stereo cable, without the mic and volume control, produces significantly better bass response in terms of presence and clarity (Update 3/26/15). YMMV

Pros
-Modular construction allows only the broken part to be replaced. This is absolutely fantastic. I have ruined many a great pair of headphones in which the driver was still functioning just fine by wearing out the stress points on the cord. Not only is the cord provided very resilient (you can see the internal braiding behind the plastic coating designed to protect the wires), but should you happen to break it you can replace just the cord for either 9.99 or 11.99 depending on if you want the micd or regular cable. Not only that, but the original package comes with both cords, so you have a backup from the get-go.

-Very accurate frequency response and great definition. I have definitely heard a lot of things through these headphones that I can't usually hear over speakers or through other headphones. Not all of the things I hear are great, but that reflects upon the production quality and bitrate of the audio files, not the headphones.

-Comes with 7 different tip options that SHOULD provide a great fit for your ear. For me, it got close, but I didn't find a perfect fit out of the box. That leads me to my next point...

-Fantastic customer service. I contacted MEElectronics after finding that none of the provided tips quite fit my ear canal and stayed there. James from their customer service department very quickly responded and asked me some questions to find out which tips I had tried, and which were the closest to a good fit. From this information he sent me another set of tips to try (sent them first-class, WOW!) that he thought would better fit my ears. One of these fit perfectly, I was very happy. James also told me that the company is discussing producing a cord that has volume buttons rather than a slider, which I would personally prefer, but nothing concrete.

-Lifetime replacement warranty. Check their replacement policy on their website, its pretty sweet. They will give you 50% off a new set as long as you just tell them what happened. Whether you run them over with your car, decide to go swimming with them, or lose them on the bus, you get 50% off a new set.

Cons
- The volume control on the micd cord is a slider NOT volume buttons. I wasn't quite sure which it was when i purchased so I want to make this fully clear. The reason this is a con is that the volume slider is ultra sensitive. The difference between WAY TOO LOUD and too quite to hear is not enough to make finding the perfect volume very easy. Also, operating a volume slider with gloves on or through a jacket is much more difficult than volume buttons. With that said, I understand that the slider works for non-smart devices whereas the buttons require a smartphone or laptop, so YMMV.

- The bass response, even once I finally arrived at a perfect fitting tip, is a little underwhelming. I am by no means a bass head, but I definitely felt like these are lacking a little bit of depth.

- Out of the box, these also have a bit of a harsh response in higher frequencies, like cymbal hits. I did find this to be mellowed out after a couple of weeks of use (I don't really buy in to the whole burn-in ideology, so I imagine I finally got a good fit and started to get used to how these headphones sound).

Neither Good nor Bad
- The hard case that comes with these is way too big to comfortably fit in a pocket or bag, but it does nicely contain all of the accessories provided. This would be good to throw into a bag or backpack, but not really useful to protect your headphones if you want to put them in your pants pocket.

- Only one size of comply foam eartips. I think its great that they include these at all, but the ones included were a bit too small for my ear, resulting in poor isolation and poor bass response.

Recommendations
-Try all of the tips, try to get them to fit as best you can, even the ones that initially feel like they couldn't possibly work. The tip that finally came the closes to fitting my ear was the larger of the two tri-flange tips that initially felt like the most uncomfortable thing I could possible jam into my ear. It took a little getting used to, but now it fits tightly, feels fine, and sounds great.

- Getting a proper fit is absolutely essential for good sound out of these headphones. The bass dies immediately if you don't have a tight seal. If none of the tips are fitting you well, contact customer service. They are extraordinarily helpful and will very likely send you some more options to try and get the right size for you.

- Properly positioning the earphones on your ear also significantly impacts comfort level and audio quality. The first few days of wearing these i had the cord angled too high and it was putting pressure on several different parts of my ear and making for a poor seal within my ear canal. Upon changing the angle, they became much more comfortable and sounded a lot better.

- These are the best quality and least expensive headphones that provide the following features: durable components, modularly replaceable and interchangeable components, included in line mic and volume control, lifetime replacement warranty that gives 50% off a replacement no matter what happens, tons of accessories in the box. The most comparable set of headphones are these:
http://www.amazon.com/Shure-SE215-K-Isolating-Earphones-MicroDriver/dp/B004PNZFZ8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426809453&sr=8-1&keywords=shure
They cost $99, don't come with a cord with an in-line mic and volume control (that will cost you an extra $50), don't come with a 6.3mm adapter, and no lifetime replacement warranty. All of their replacement parts and accessories are also more expensive. I haven't listened to the shure headphones, so I cant comment on sound quality.

I have had these for about 3 weeks. I will update if anything changes. MEElectronics does not pay me or give me any products for review. I don't find myself qualified to talk much about the audio-quality other than on a very basic level, so I didn't.

Update (3/26/15): I finally got the chance to sit down and switch back and forth between the regular stereo cable and the cable that includes the microphone and volume control. I noticed a significant difference in bass response between the two cables. the plain stereo cable sounds significantly better in terms of bass response than the cable with volume control does. I switched back and forth between the two cables, listening to the first minute of the song Dissolved Girl by Massive Attack on each 3 times, and each time the bass response was much more present, clear, and well defined on the plain cable than the volume control cable. My GUESS here is that the potentiometer used for the slide volume control is somehow reducing audio quality, if anyone else has any idea why this is happening, feel free to comment in response.

This is kind of a double edged sword for me. Im disappointed that I have to sacrifice the functionality of the in-line remote and volume control for better sound quality, but at the same time I'm quite happy to be getting the bass response I felt was lacking when listening on the mic'd cable.

Perhaps MEElectronics will address this issue and release a better quality mic'd cable, hopefully with volume buttons.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2015",Rocky,Verified

quality i have had these for about weeks i will update if anything changes meelectronics does not pay me or give me any products for review i dont find myself qualified to talk much about the audioquality other than on a very basic level so i didnt update i finally got the chance to sit down and switch back and forth between the regular stereo cable and the cable that includes the microphone and volume control i noticed a significant difference in bass response between the two cables the plain stereo cable sounds significantly better in terms of bass response than the cable with volume control does i switched back and forth between the two cables listening to the first minute of the song dissolved girl by massive attack on each times and each time the bass response was much more present clear and well defined on the plain cable than the volume control cable my guess here is that the potentiometer used for the slide volume control is somehow reducing audio quality if anyone else has any idea why this is happening feel free to comment in response this is kind of a double edged sword for me im disappointed that i have to sacrifice the functionality of the inline remote and volume control for better sound quality but at the same time im quite happy to be getting the bass response i felt was lacking when listening on the micd cable perhaps meelectronics will address this issue and release a better quality micd cable hopefully with volume buttons,meelectronics has made a fantastic product backed by a great warranty with easily replaceable parts due to modular construction and fantastic customer service to right any wrongs and answer questions truth told though i would probably give the product itself a or a but its the customer service provided by the company that bumps these headphones up to a star rating bottom line buy them for youre getting a great sounding set of headphones that will last you a long time with parts that are easy to replace so that they last you an even longer time and keep some electronics out of the landfill plus it is obvious that meelectronics stands behind their product with great customer service and a fantastic lifetime replacement program be aware that they take a little getting used to and finding a proper fit is important to enjoying these headphones the volume control is a slider not buttons just something to be aware of if you have a preference i find that the plain stereo cable without the mic and volume control produces significantly better bass response in terms of presence and clarity update ymmv pros modular construction allows only the broken part to be replaced this is absolutely fantastic i have ruined many a great pair of headphones in which the driver was still functioning just fine by wearing out the stress points on the cord not only is the cord provided very resilient you can see the internal braiding behind the plastic coating designed to protect the wires but should you happen to break it you can replace just the cord for either or depending on if you want the micd or regular cable not only that but the original package comes with both cords so you have a backup from the getgo very accurate frequency response and great definition i have definitely heard a lot of things through these headphones that i cant usually hear over speakers or through other headphones not all of the things i hear are great but that reflects upon the production quality and bitrate of the audio files not the headphones comes with different tip options that should provide a great fit for your ear for me it got close but i didnt find a perfect fit out of the box that leads me to my next point fantastic customer service i contacted meelectronics after finding that none of the provided tips quite fit my ear canal and stayed there james from their customer service department very quickly responded and asked me some questions to find out which tips i had tried and which were the closest to a good fit from this information he sent me another set of tips to try sent them firstclass wow that he thought would better fit my ears one of these fit perfectly i was very happy james also told me that the company is discussing producing a cord that has volume buttons rather than a slider which i would personally prefer but nothing concrete lifetime replacement warranty check their replacement policy on their website its pretty sweet they will give you off a new set as long as you just tell them what happened whether you run them over with your car decide to go swimming with them or lose them on the bus you get off a new set cons the volume control on the micd cord is a slider not volume buttons i wasnt quite sure which it was when i purchased so i want to make this fully clear the reason this is a con is that the volume slider is ultra sensitive the difference between way too loud and too quite to hear is not enough to make finding the perfect volume very easy also operating a volume slider with gloves on or through a jacket is much more difficult than volume buttons with that said i understand that the slider works for nonsmart devices whereas the buttons require a smartphone or laptop so ymmv the bass response even once i finally arrived at a perfect fitting tip is a little underwhelming i am by no means a bass head but i definitely felt like these are lacking a little bit of depth out of the box these also have a bit of a harsh response in higher frequencies like cymbal hits i did find this to be mellowed out after a couple of weeks of use i dont really buy in to the whole burnin ideology so i imagine i finally got a good fit and started to get used to how these headphones sound neither good nor bad the hard case that comes with these is way too big to comfortably fit in a pocket or bag but it does nicely contain all of the accessories provided this would be good to throw into a bag or backpack but not really useful to protect your headphones if you want to put them in your pants pocket only one size of comply foam eartips i think its great that they include these at all but the ones included were a bit too small for my ear resulting in poor isolation and poor bass response recommendations try all of the tips try to get them to fit as best you can even the ones that initially feel like they couldnt possibly work the tip

B0BNCJ5DNY,Muy bonito pero muy incómodo para extraer un audífono.,"First off, I never even realized that there were as many of these ""sleep buds"" as I'm now seeing. I was looking for Bluetooth headphones of the same ilk, and the closest I've come were a headband style. And in terms of comfort, those are okay-ish...but nowhere in the same league as the ones I'm reviewing right now.

That said, my initial thought, when seeing that all of these sleep style buds are wired, was that of disappointment. But for the price, it makes total sense and isn't a surprise.

To the actual review, short and to the point:

1. Comfort: Perhaps one of, if not THE most comfortable in ear buds wired OR wireless, ever. Seriously. Usually I loathe silicone tips, but these are a serious exception.

The driver is in an incredibly short and narrow and soft silicone housing. Being short and narrow is the key to not killing your ears when on your side.

The soft and very flexible silicone is what lends itself to not giving your ears fatigue for long listening stints.

2. Sound Quality: I was sort of expecting the type of sound Quality you'd get from the plastic tube headphones on airplanes back in the 80's. But what I hear is more akin to fairly decent Bluetooth headphones in the $40 range. They sound like a few pairs that I own for sure. So...very nice surprise. They won't win any awards for detail or soundstage, but in a pinch, they're quite good.

I bought these for podcasts and ASMR though, and in that context, they're killer. They sound MUCH better than some Bluetooth buds in that regard.

Also, the noise isolation is fantastic. But... It also relates to the one downside I can think of....

Cons: If I had to come up with one negative (which I've found a solution to), it would be cable microphonics. Because the noise isolation is so great, you can hear a lot of noise when the cables move. These are microphonics.

There's an easy fix for that though... Just take the cable and loop it over your ear. Done. Almost zero noise now. The only thing that would make these better is if they had a cable tassel attached, so that you could keep the cables taught near your chin.

Oh...The controls. They are perfect. Big enough buttons to feel each one and the whole thing is very light weight so as not to be uncomfortable or awkward.

I'll probably get another pair or two (might try a different brand too) just in case.

Last word:. I've fallen asleep wearing these a few times now, and cannot recommend these highly enough.",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2022",Javier,Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0BNCJ5DNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2,"BD&M Wireless Earbuds, HiFi Digital LED Display Stereo Gaming Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones, TWS Wireless Earphones in-Ear Ear Buds, for Gaming, Workout, Sports, Work, Running, Gym",Brand: BD&M,3.9 out of 5 stars,"About this item【One Step Pairing Technology and LED Battery Display】 Open the charging case and you can automatically and seamlessly pair this device with your Bluetooth-Compatible device without any problem.

It has a good sized screen, but it's very thin and light. Battery life is outstanding- still 70% after a full day of use.

But don't let it fool you!

Excellent picture quality, better than my old Samsung cellphone....

The battery life, when I play music on my Bluetooth music hat, while using YouTube, it will last almost 8 hours.... That is with the battery saver on too...

But when not playing YouTube on my music hat, with the battery savor on, it can last awhile...

Like, my cellphone was fully charged at 5:30 am on 10-22... It's now 3:26 am 10-23 and the battery is at 74%..... Again, I have the battery saver on as well....

I rarely get calls during the day because I work midnights....

B01LXF0WML,Five Stars,"When I started looking for a new smart phones, I wanted something that was useful and inexpensive to suit my meager needs. I mainly use my smartphone for phone calls, as a GPS unit, and to manage a few apps. I have a dedicated digital camera and I'm not a ""power user"" when it comes to a smart phone. So the Moto E from Motorola seemed like the perfect entry level phone for me to try out. So far, after a month of use, I am very happy with the phone. Voice calls are clear and the volume has good range for when I'm outside in noisy environments or inside in quite ones.

The built in GPS has worked well for me on a 250 mile trip. It got me straight to my destination and worked well in the city areas once I got there.

The battery lasts me all day and night, although I don't play video's or music all or most of the day long. I end the night at about 50 percent charge after using the ""My disney"" app on and off most of the day, and making three or four phone calls during a normal day and evening.
I would like to see a removable battery, so that I could just carry an extra and swap it out if I ever run really low on battery power while in a park like Disney World or Universal Studios where charging isn't an immediate and viable option. I have a small portable charger that I bought in case this happens, but it's not nearly as effective a solution as a replaceable battery would be.

The camera works pretty well for what it is, and on occasions that I am not carrying my much larger digital camera with me, the phone camera does the job for basic photo's. I do wish it had a flash, as I like to take photo's of various meals at restaurants that I go to, as well as for dinner photos of my girlfriend and myself at various new restaurants that we go to.

I used information from an article by Dennis Bournique.

The data is HSPA+ which is pretty fast. I played games, watched YouTube and Netflix with no problems.

Pros:
-Data works well
-Beautiful Design looks expensive
-Clear videos
-Downloaded over 15 apps so far
-Comes with silicon case

Cons:
-Camera is just ok. Not very good at night. I have an iphone 5 which is 8MP and the pictures from this phone do not measure up. They seem more like 5MP or less.
-Lack of stronger cases available for purchase which is needed for those of us who frequently drop phones

It's a great little device for music that can take pictures and record video, too.

B07K3X5JTP,Decent phone,"Always been a huge fan of Samsung Galaxy so when my boyfriend was in the market for a new phone that's where we started. We were a little apprehensive of the reviews we had seen but decided to try it. It arrived in perfect brand new shape. Fully functional. We still need to activate it with a SIM card so when we have done that, I will update review. Until then, 5 stars!!

Update!!
So it turns out this is an international phone. We had to order a brand new SIM for it (we chose StraightTalk) and it is now active and working! If you choose to order this phone and wind up with an international phone you will need to tell StraightTalk customer service that it is an international phone or else they will act like it's a locked phone that you cannot use when actually all you need is a brand new SIM for only 99 cents!

B00KR0VJVM,Htc desire 816,"This phone skipped bootcamp and went right into action. I bought this phone 5 days before leaving for 22 days in China. I had just sent my awful LG G3 to Ft Worth for its 3rd attempt at repair and was without a phone. This little gem had me asking why I ever bought the G3. By the way, to hopefully save you some trouble, don't buy LG. Their products are shady and their service is despicable. They absolutely refused to replace or reimburse me for my malfunctioning G3--all software related. Instead they took three swings at repairing it and it still doesn't work right.

But enough of that. I wanted to praise this wonderful phone. Build quality is very nice. It feels and looks expensive. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the camera is SUPERIOR to the camera in my G3. I've seen a lot of the ""jello"" wobbly video effect in my G3, which is completely absent from this camera. The colors are rich and vibrant. I carried a Fuji XE-2 camera with me in China, but did use the phone for lots of quick videos and photos. I'm really impressed with the HDR photos and the speed and accuracy and of focus. Because of the water resistance, I didn't worry about the occasional rain I experienced, though I tend to throw everything electronic into my backpack when the rain falls.

I used the phone for messaging back home and domestic messaging and calls in China and it worked great. The US style charging plug that came with the phone was compatible with the sockets in Chinese hotels...though I think that goes for most phones these days.

For surfing the web, the phone is quick and responsive. I can't speak to how it handles gaming, as I haven't yet installed any games.

The phone has no wasteful bloatware, so like a lot of folks say, it's yours to build as you like. I really can't see how you can go wrong with this phone.

B0933K762G,Screen wouldn't turn on,"The phone delivered ahead of schedule by my vendor.

Now on the product itself: Unlocked Samsung Galaxy S3.

This is an European version and require correct adopter to recharge. Fortunately for me, I have an universal mobile charger that works on this phone as well.

What I like about this phone: Fast, efficient speed processor. Smooth and easy navigation. The design is light and thin. My hands are quite small and was reluctant of holding this size screen size phone when I got it a month ago. Now, I became comfortable holding the Galaxy S3.

I also liked the battery life-it last quite long.

I am a T Mobile customer and still have 12 months left to fulfill my 2 year contract obligation. I also found out through T Mobile technical support that my data will be around 2G~3G speed but that didn't stop me from purchasing the unlocked samsung Galaxy S3: I just didn't want to tie to a contract and I will stay with T Mobile after my contract is fulfilled. For what I do, the data speed was not that bad and I use primarily in wifi environment.

B0CKTZVB17,"So far, so good.","What the title says. It's great for gaming if you want this laptop to never last then go ahead let it push and die in a year. I played games like hell let loose, halo infinite, elden ring, assassin's creed valhalla and also do a lot of rendering work and while it's normal for these games to get these laptops hot, this thing went up to 90c to 100c hot. This is with a cooling pad, and the fan running at turbo and some how managed to hit tjmax. The build is decent and has seen some abuse such as accidentally dropping it a few times and never noticing any substantial drop in performance. On the other hand, too bad it'll drop in performance anyways when the interior gets so hot that it needs turbo on all the time as the cpu gets so hot that it lowers the clock speed to save itself. Also, The predator button is the stupidest design choice i've ever seen and the program itself manages to take 20% of cpu load and make the laptop hotter by having the program running by itself. I don't care if I can change the predator button's settings, as having it where the num lock is annoying and shows how much acer cared about keyboard design when they first made this.

Also installing ssd wasn't bad, but the tutorials are much like acer's monitor quality: bad. Didn't show me where to stick the slim thing to open up the laptop so i can install another ssd in there.

For what it's worth and almost a year with this thing and I have a lot of resentment with this laptop, and that i'll use it until it dies and then go elsewhere.

UPDATE: Oh yeah I forgot about about the overly sensitive mousepad. It's so bad that they thought adding the FN + f2 key would fix an obvious awful design issue that they think a bandage will prevent frustrations. If I Have to press fn + f2 key every time I had to switch from gaming to internet surfing to gaming then why should I even bother buying a laptop to begin with? That thing is neck deep almsot near the space bar that it gets in the way of communication. Meanwhile so many other laptops with similar designs such as small arrow keys to knowing where to place their mouse pad so when you place your hand on wasd, it shouldn't result in an accidental discharge in CS:GO and give away your position.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022",thomas,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CKTZVB17/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2,"HP 17 Laptop, 17.3"" HD+ Touchscreen Display, 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1255U, 64GB RAM, 2TB SSD, Webcam, HDMI, SuperSpeed USB Ports, Wi-Fi 6, Windows 11 Home, Silver",Visit the HP Store,4.1 out of 5 stars,"About this item【High Speed RAM And Enormous Space】64GB high-bandwidth RAM to smoothly run multiple applications and browser tabs all at once;

B0CPTB7H6Q,"Whether you love or hate reality TV, you will love this book!","If you, like myself, grew up in the 90s and early aughts, reality tv has been playing in the background on that chunky box of a television our entire lives. It’s the tv genre everyone loves to hate and hates to love.

In Cue the Sun! The Invention of Reality TV by Emily Nussbaum, we are walked through the history of reality television, from the Newlywed Game all the way to The Real Housewives of whatever city is currently on.

Throughout the book, Nussbaum dives into some of our most iconic reality shows chronologically to demonstrate not only how the genre came to be, but how each show shaped the future of television. (All while being the black sheep of the TV world.)

For myself, someone who has loved reality tv their whole life while also complaining about it (keeping up the kardashians irks me) this book is everything. Not only is Cue the Sun! packed with information, it’s told like a tell all full of industry gossip. Not only did I gobble this up, I found myself down memory lane watching old favorites like The Real World and Big Brother. Say what you will about reality tv, but it’s definitely a cultural time capsule that is readily available to everyone everywhere.

B08952VZ14,The earbuds fit smaller ears ver well.,"We know we're here for the (relatively) cheaper end of the price range for earphones and, given that, hopefully our expectations are also realistic. I have bought so many of these over time and can compare. The neckband style has emerged as a personal favorite - it just seems the most comfortable for long-term listening purposes.

My expectations for earphones are:
1. Must have decent sound (not tinny, not too low, not screechy); I don't expect anything ""fancy"" or bother about the boom, bass etc. and I don't look for these features at this price range;
2. Must have a good battery life - 10 to 12 hours play on one charge is the basic expectation as that's a given nowadays irrespective of price and anything longer than that would be wow;
3. Must be a comfortable fit in the ears - this is a deal breaker; it must not fall off and has to be comfortable nestling in the ears for several hours.
The final feature is not really a deal breaker but good to have -
4. Must have a functional mic- listener should be able to hear consistently over a 1-2 hrs call without much background noise interference.

These earphones scored 10/10 on points 1 and 2 and 8/10 on point 4. The sound and mic are good; the battery life is insanely good! This is the only one out of the many I tried that lived up to its claim of long battery life and then some! Granted I tried out only for a few days but this had the best battery life out of all the cheaper ones and better than even the more expensive ones I tried. So no complaints at all with any of these features.

The failure to meet my expectation no. 3 was the only reason to return this. I couldn't wear this for more than 30mins without the ear buds starting to hurt my ears. They have additional fin attachments that were extremely uncomfortable for me. I followed the instructions correctly, put them in and did the little turn, and while it did stay securely inside, within a few minutes it started to hurt. Since I'm not a fan of those fin tips, I thought I'd remove them and simply use with the regular buds but nope - see the pic - there's that freakin lil pink protrusion that starts biting into the ear. Why is that there! Is that supposed to anchor the fin attachment? But why is it that big and sharp and jutting out so much!? The fin covers it yes, but the fin was uncomfortable for me.

So there you have it - the only point where this didn't meet my expectation was my deal breaker point. It has to be comfortable in the ear or it's a no. Very disappointed as otherwise this is an amazingggg pair of earphones. Maybe others won't find it uncomfortable using the fin tips. Give me the same pair but without that uncomfortable bit and I'd buy these over and over and gift to all my family and friends. I have tried a lot of these earphones and this was absolutely head and shoulders above the others on most points especially the battery life.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022",P.

B0CHN7M531,Switched From Z Fold 6,"Well I was stuck between paying for the Note 3 and being locked into a two year contract (or at least until the phone was paid off) through T-mobile or remaining contractless buy just outright buying a phone. I didn't exactly have the extra funds available to just buy like a $700 phone. So, a co-worker told me about BLU phones. After checking out their website, I decided I wanted the BLU Pure Life XL. However, I was uneasy about forking over $400 for a phone by a company I had never heard of. After much debating with myself, I decided to get the BLU Life Pure.

I have to give kudos to Amazon's customer service. The first phone I ordered was stolen off my porch and Amazon sent me a replacement. It was a flawless process!

Anyway, I've had the phone for a couple of days now and I love it! When the phone arrived, I popped my sim card from my Nexus 4 to the BLU Life Pure. It was quite simple. I had no issues putting my sim card in and it instantly started working on T-mobile's network. I did pick up 4g and honestly.... I have no issues with speed. The phone is pretty fast on T-mobile's network. Of course, I live in a big city. I have no idea what it would be like out in the country. The phone picks up wireless networks and connects to them flawlessly as well. Also, I can create hotspots with the phone. I was excited to find that out cause I connect my tablet to my hot spot at work.

The phone has a 13 megapixel camera and it takes very good pictures though not so great in low light. The front-facing camera is great too and I like that you can add effects to the pictures. The stock launcher on it reminds me of the iPhone. It's not bad but I don't care for it so I use Nova Launcher and I customized the phone the way I liked it. I use Nova Launcher on pretty much all Android phones anyway. The phone also has 32GB of space. I downloaded two huge games (FF3 and FF4) from the Playstore and I still got plenty of space left. It handles graphic intensive games pretty well. I noticed no lag while playing FF3. The only issue I've encountered with the playstore is that The Sims Free Play wasn't compatible with the phone and that's not a big deal for me. However, everything else I play and use has downloaded with absolutely no problems.

The sound is very good. The phone is loud and I love that! That was an issue I had with my Nexus 4 - I thought the sound was way too low. I have no trouble hearing people on phone calls and everyone says they can hear me just fine. The sound for the speaker phone is just right in my opinion - not too low, not too loud. I must admit though, holding the phone up to your ear can get uncomfortable due to the corners of the phone.

I did have some trouble connecting the bluetooth to my car. For whatever reason, my phone wouldn't detect the bluetooth in my car but then one night while trying, my car's bluetooth suddenly popped up and it connected with no problems. So I'm able to stream music through my phone. The music did sound better through my Nexus 4; however, it doesn't sound bad with the BLU Life Pure (just not as good). But I'm not really an audiophile so I can't really explain the difference but there is a difference. The music really sounds ""just okay"" vs. ""omfg awesome"" coming through my car speakers via bluetooth. With my Nexus 4, it would show the name of the song across the screen of my radio but not with the BLU Life Pure. I'm not sure why but it's not that big of a deal. At least it works. Now, I have been having trouble connecting my JBL speaker to the phone. It seems the Life Pure really sucks at detecting bluetooth connections. But when it does, there is usually no problems with actually connecting it.

I've been told by quite a few people that the phone looks like an iphone. I don't really see that myself but since I've had two co-workers and my brother tell me that, I guess it must be true. Also, the phone feels lighter than it looks. I was really surprised by how light the phone feels. I know that making phones really light is the trend now but I personally prefer phones that feel a bit heavier. But it's all good.

I've dropped the phone a few times and it still works just fine. No cracks or anything in the screen. So I'd say thus far it's pretty durable.

I don't know how well the GPS works cause I haven't used it.

Other than not being able to download The Sims Free Play, I've yet to see this phone do something my Nexus 4 couldn't do. I love this phone and BLU has made a believer out of me. I'm an average user... things about processors and ram makes no sense to me. I just want to know can my phone connect to the internet? Can I talk and text? Can I take at least decent pictures? Can I connect it to bluetooth? Can I download my favorite games? The answer to all these questions are YES! So the phone gets a 5/5 rating from me! The phone is so cool! I love it! My brother is even considering buying one now. I think this phone is awesome for the price tag that comes with it. When I do decide to upgrade my phone again, I'll definitely be purchasing another BLU phone.

and thats not a big deal for me however everything else i play and use has downloaded with absolutely no problems the sound is very good the phone is loud and i love that that was an issue i had with my nexus i thought the sound was way too low i have no trouble hearing people on phone calls and everyone says they can hear me just fine the sound for the speaker phone is just right in my opinion not too low not too loud i must admit though holding the phone up to your ear can get uncomfortable due to the corners of the phone i did have some trouble connecting the bluetooth to my car for whatever reason my phone wouldnt detect the bluetooth in my car but then one night while trying my cars bluetooth suddenly popped up and it connected with no problems so im able to stream music through my phone the music did sound better through my nexus however it doesnt sound bad with the blu life pure just not as good but im not really an audiophile so i cant really explain the difference but there is a difference the music really sounds just okay vs omfg awesome coming through my car speakers via bluetooth with my nexus it would show the name of the song across the screen of my radio but not with the blu life pure im not sure why but its not that big of a deal at least it works now i have been having trouble connecting my jbl speaker to the phone it seems the life pure really sucks at detecting bluetooth connections but when it does there is usually no problems with actually connecting it ive been told by quite a few people that the phone looks like an iphone i dont really see that myself but since ive had two coworkers and my brother tell me that i guess it must be true also the phone feels lighter than it looks i was really surprised by how light the phone feels i know that making phones really light is the trend now but i personally prefer phones that feel a bit heavier but its all good ive dropped the phone a few times and it still works just fine no cracks or anything in the screen so id say thus far its pretty durable i dont know how well the gps works cause i havent used it other than not being able to download the sims free play ive yet to see this phone do something my nexus couldnt do i love this phone and blu has made a believer out of me im an average user things about processors and ram makes no sense to me i just want to know can my phone connect to the internet can i talk and text can i take at least decent pictures can i connect it to bluetooth can i download my favorite games the answer to all these questions are yes so the phone gets a rating from me the phone is so cool i love it my brother is even considering buying one now i think this phone is awesome for the price tag that comes with it when i do decide to upgrade my phone again ill definitely be purchasing another blu phone no more phones that cost more than my car note,1,Positive,1,2

B005ZEF01A,Unlocked and brand new and directly upgradable toJelly Bean OS,"I was worried after coming from a Galaxy S4 that the decrease in screen resolution and density would stand out as a step backwards but after a few hours with the phone I'm quite happy with the screen. In fact it looks quite good. The CPU is quite fast and installing tons of applications was quick and I'm up and running with this phone looking similar to the S4, apps and all. The nano-SIM is quite small, I'd never seen one and although it's quite finicky to insert, you'll likely only do that once.
I had begun saving all personal stuff on a microSD and after inserting it into this phone all my data is transfered. Google of course took care of the contacts and the likes.

Good:
° Good build quality (It's Nokia afterall).
° Good call reception. My mother says she hears clearly when talking on the phone. No issues with signal.
° Keypad is comfortable and responsive.

Not So Good:
° The screen could have been designed with a better resolution.

B07GNHBRKT,Great phone,"Had a few days with the phone now. The hardware is fantastic for the price ($300 at the time of this review). Games play smoothly with 3GB and Snapdragon 808. Very light phone if you are concerned about weight. Display is lovely. No app drawer in marshmallow is weird, but a launcher can fix that. Not sure about the cloud storage idea, as I haven't had to use it. The design of the phone looks nice but isn't very practical. The power button, also the fingerprint sensor, is flush with the side of the phone, making it harder to use. The phone material is so smooth (and the phone is so thin) that it is hard to pick up if you set it on a flat surface like a table, so you will need a case. Unfortunately there aren't many cases available. Also, make sure you have a nano sim for it and type-c cords or converters ready if you like to have chargers available at home, with, car, etc.

B01M1HXWL9,Great,"I'll leave the in-depth feature breakdown for others, but this phone gets 5 stars from me because of the value proposition.

Honestly this phone, at less than half the price, functions as well as phones that are double (or more) the price. And is not pre-loaded with any extra junky apps from carriers.

All of the google apps work just fine, it is faster than my old phone (an older Samsung), and it has a 5-inch screen which is quite roomy. With light use I go 2 days without looking for a charger, and with more heavy use (music streaming, YouTube, etc.) battery life still lasts all day long.

I couple of times during my commute (1-hour bus trip) my phone froze up, but I think that was due to trying to stream audio/video while the bus went in and out of coverage areas. Anyway, this behavior didn't really surprise me and I would expect that on other phones.

If there is ONE drawback that I see with the phone, it is that the camera is slow or finicky to focus. I am getting better at using it, at first many photos I took were slightly blurred. But the camera is still OK, and I take plenty of pictures with it, it was just a stumbling block at first. Undoubtedly the $600 phones have better cameras or focusing logic, but I'm not willing to shell out that much for a slightly better camera.

For what I'm getting and for the price I paid, I think this is the best deal going.

B01BWVXB9C,Just What I was looking,"Darn hard to open the back cover; in fact, I couldn't open it without taking atool to it which would most likely ruin the product. I had to return it for the Nokia X3-02 model, which I already have and the new one would be used for another carrier SIM card. I am providing a review of my limited but informative experience.

The 220 is bigger than it looks (I was hoping it would be the size of the Motorola Rockr (a well built phone--couldn't find batteries for it anymore)). It is light and the complete back casing where the phone's face snaps into the rear housing-case is good at eliminating dirt and what-not that tends to get into the back of phones. It feels like a $50 phone; buttons feels a little cheap--not cheap but a little cheap--like $50 cheap. There is no open anywhere else other than for the charger and headphone jacks. Here's the problem this phone posed for me that make it not workable for my purposes: I do not like to ""transfer"" my files on the SD micro card; I like to pop it out of the phone, insert it into a thumb USB drive and plug it into my computer to open (I avoid all the registering, logging in here and there, updates that and this, tracking me here and there, and all the other pain in the butt trailer tagging electronic vendors tie to your every move/use. So access to the SD card is often and since I couldn't even open the back cover off to put the phone's battery it, (if you have joint problems or joint issues this phone is not for you) well, it wouldn't work for me. It looks like a snap on video, but it's a serious impediment in real life, and I'm no weakling--I'm sure I could open it with the beyond normally required force, but I could have snap or break something inside rendering it less desirable. If I have to exert more than normally required, it would not work for me who routinely removes the SD card. For me, regardless of how well it functions, for my purposes, the hard to open back cover was the deal breaker.

I already have a Nokia X3-02 and that's a great phone; really thin, super sleek; I don't care what phone you have, when I pull the X3-02 out, I get double looks. I just didn't want to have two of the same, but it looks like that's my only option in the unlock GMS candy-bar style.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2015",Amazon Customer,Verified Purchase,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01BWVXB9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1,,,,,Mobile,darn hard to open the back cover in fact i couldnt open it without taking atool to it which would most likely ruin the product i had to return it for the nokia x model which i already have and the new one would be used for another carrier sim card i am providing a review of my limited but informative experience the is bigger than it looks i was hoping it would be the size of the motorola rockr a well built phonecouldnt find batteries for it anymore it is light and the complete back casing where the phones face snaps into the rear housingcase is good at eliminating dirt and whatnot that tends to get into the back of phones it feels like a phone buttons feels a little cheapnot cheap but a little cheaplike cheap there is no open anywhere else other than for the charger and headphone jacks heres the problem this phone posed for me that make it not workable for my purposes i do not like to transfer my files on the sd micro card i like to pop it out of the phone insert it into a thumb usb drive and plug it into my computer to open i avoid all the registering logging in here and there updates that and this tracking me here and there and all the other pain in the butt trailer tagging electronic vendors tie to your every moveuse so access to the sd card is often and since i couldnt even open the back cover off to put the phones battery it if you have joint problems or joint issues this phone is not for you well it wouldnt work for me it looks like a snap on video but its a serious impediment in real life and im no weaklingim sure i could open it with the beyond normally required force but i could have snap or break something inside rendering it less desirable if i have to exert more than normally required it would not work for me who routinely removes the sd card for me regardless of how well it functions for my purposes the hard to open back cover was the deal breaker i already have a nokia x and thats a great phone really thin super sleek i dont care what phone you have when i pull the x out i get double looks i just didnt want to have two of the same but it looks like thats my only option in the unlock gms candybar style,darn hard to open the back cover in fact i couldnt open it without taking atool to it which would most likely ruin the product i had to return it for the nokia x model which i already have and the new one would be used for another carrier sim card i am providing a review of my limited but informative experience the is bigger than it looks i was hoping it would be the size of the motorola rockr a well built phonecouldnt find batteries for it anymore it is light and the complete back casing where the phones face snaps into the rear housingcase is good at eliminating dirt and whatnot that tends to get into the back of phones it feels like a phone buttons feels a little cheapnot cheap but a little cheaplike cheap there is no open anywhere else other than for the charger and headphone jacks heres the problem this phone posed for me that make it not workable for my purposes i do not like to transfer my files on the sd micro card i like to pop it out of the phone insert it into a thumb usb drive and plug it into my computer to open i avoid all the registering logging in here and there updates that and this tracking me here and there and all the other pain in the butt trailer tagging electronic vendors tie to your every moveuse so access to the sd card is often and since i couldnt even open the back cover off to put the phones battery it if you have joint problems or joint issues this phone is not for you well it wouldnt work for me it looks like a snap on video but its a serious impediment in real life and im no weaklingim sure i could open it with the beyond normally required force but i could have snap or break something inside rendering it less desirable if i have to exert more than normally required it would not work for me who routinely removes the sd card for me regardless of how well it functions for my purposes the hard to open back cover was the deal breaker i already have a nokia x and thats a great phone really thin super sleek i dont care what phone you have when i pull the x out i get double looks i just didnt want to have two of the same but it looks like thats my only option in the unlock gms candybar style,0,Negative,0,0
B0B92ZFQ6D,So far so good!,"I have a problem with earbuds. They never seem to fit right and often cause discomfort. I've only found one pair that worked for me, and it was just some cheap brand from China, and I used a mismatched pair of tip attachments with them. Even with the optional attachments that my Galaxy Buds came with, I had the same problem with these.

I purchased some third-party memory foam tips and now they are a little more comfortable and isolate sound even better. They still cause slight discomfort after hours of use though. Your mileage may vary with the comfort, especially if ear buds usually work for you.

The noise cancellation (especially after buying memory foam tips) and the ambient sound function is astounding. I was walking at the park with my buds in (and no music playing) and couldn't hear a thing. I held my finger on one of the buds to turn on ambient sound and could clearly hear the rain, my own footsteps, and birds chirping. (Note: in the Galaxy Wearables app you can change some of the touch commands, by default this would start Spotify, I set mine to toggle ambient sound and also keep the ambient sound set to high. I recommend this if you think you might want to talk to people or hear the world around you!)

Sound quality is pretty good. I am no audiophile, but I would say it is 'good' (not amazing or great, but good) and comparable to other, less expensive earbuds I've bought in the past. It doesn't sound as good as my surround sound over-ear gaming headphones, but it sounds better than some of the 10 dollar ones I've gotten. The bass boost option in the Wearables app is also a plus.

Charge time for the pod and buds seems relatively short and they hold a charge for a good several hours. I'm extremely happy with the battery life and the convenience of the charging pod. I've never had them die on me even after hours of continuous use and a couple days without being plugged in. In the app you can also see exactly how charged each bud and the pod is, which has helped me to not let them drain to zero charge.

The microphone is clear and they work well for calls also. Although my phone did not seem to use them for calls at first, but then at a later time it decided to start using them. Not sure why. I have a Galaxy S10. I also had some issues with one of the buds not charging at first because the little charging diodes were not making proper contact.

Overall, I'd say these are amazingly convenient, hold a charge, and have good noise isolation. The app works nicely and sound quality is good for this style of headphones. I docked one star because of the discomfort I originally had before ordering memory foam tips, and because my phone inexplicably did not recognize the buds at first for calls. Also, the charging pod can be finnicky if the buds are not making proper contact on the little metal diodes.

I don't think I can go back to buds with short battery lifes and extra wires after using these!",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2020",,Verified Purchase,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B92ZFQ6D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3,True Wireless Earbuds Purple Bluetooth 5.3 with Microphone for Working Out Noise Canceling Blue Tooth Ear Buds Deep Bass TWS Wireless Earphones with Charging Case in Ear Headphone for iPhone Android,Visit the Xmenha Store,4.3 out of 5 stars,"About this item🎧 LATEST BLUETOOTH 5.3 & QUICK PAIRING - The earbuds wireless equipped with the latest Bluetooth 5.3 technology, the transmission speed is faster and the range is wider.

one pair that worked for me and it was just some cheap brand from china and i used a mismatched pair of tip attachments with them even with the optional attachments that my galaxy buds came with i had the same problem with these i purchased some thirdparty memory foam tips and now they are a little more comfortable and isolate sound even better they still cause slight discomfort after hours of use though your mileage may vary with the comfort especially if ear buds usually work for you the noise cancellation especially after buying memory foam tips and the ambient sound function is astounding i was walking at the park with my buds in and no music playing and couldnt hear a thing i held my finger on one of the buds to turn on ambient sound and could clearly hear the rain my own footsteps and birds chirping note in the galaxy wearables app you can change some of the touch commands by default this would start spotify i set mine to toggle ambient sound and also keep the ambient sound set to high i recommend this if you think you might want to talk to people or hear the world around you sound quality is pretty good i am no audiophile but i would say it is good not amazing or great but good and comparable to other less expensive earbuds ive bought in the past it doesnt sound as good as my surround sound overear gaming headphones but it sounds better than some of the dollar ones ive gotten the bass boost option in the wearables app is also a plus charge time for the pod and buds seems relatively short and they hold a charge for a good several hours im extremely happy with the battery life and the convenience of the charging pod ive never had them die on me even after hours of continuous use and a couple days without being plugged in in the app you can also see exactly how charged each bud and the pod is which has helped me to not let them drain to zero charge the microphone is clear and they work well for calls also although my phone did not seem to use them for calls at first but then at a later time it decided to start using them not sure why i have a galaxy s i also had some issues with one of the buds not charging at first because the little charging diodes were not making proper contact overall id say these are amazingly convenient hold a charge and have good noise isolation the app works nicely and sound quality is good for this style of headphones i docked one star because of the discomfort i originally had before ordering memory foam tips and because my phone inexplicably did not recognize the buds at first for calls also the charging pod can be

B00LBGHM12,Five Stars,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review. I have been using the Huawei Mate 20 Pro as my primary smartphone for about 2 weeks now and I can confidently say that it's the best phone I've ever used. I'm a big technology buff and I like to keep up with the latest smartphone trends, so when I was given the opportunity to test the latest flagship phone from Huawei, I jumped at the chance. Upon unboxing the phone you quickly realise that you're dealing with a premium product, it's got a metal and glass build and has sleek curves on the back aswell as a curved screen on the front. It's very comfortable to hold and has a good amount of weight to it. When switching the phone on you're greeted with a brilliant 6.39"" AMOLED display which is absolutely gorgeous. The phone has a substantial notch eating into the screen space but it can be forgiven because it has some impressive 3D face scanning technology built in which is not only secure, it's super fast at unlocking the phone too. The phone runs on Huawei's latest Kirin 980 Processor and is blazing fast no matter what you throw at it. The processor is also very battery efficient and this combined with the massive 4200 MAh means that this phone will last even the heaviest of users a full day and some. One of the main features that attracted me to this phone is the camera setup, it has 3 lenses on the back. A normal, wide angle and telephoto zoom lens. This hardware combined with the AI on board means that photos taken on this camera are simply stunning. The main lens is a 40 megapixel effort and this can produce impressive detail in shots and the night mode simply has to be seen to be believed. I will attach some photos I have taken with this phone at the end of this review for you to view so you can see for yourself how good the cameras are. Now I would like to mention the only bit of this phone that I don't like and it's the same thing that lets every Huawei phone down in my opinion, the software. The phone runs the latest version of Android with Huawei's EMUI skin overlay. EMUI adds many extra features that aren't standard across all Android phones which is good but the visual design isn't to my taste and the volume of bloatware apps that come pre-installed is totally unnecessary. To summarise, I believe that this phone has some exceptional hardware which is slightly let down by the not so good software.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 20, 2019",Jerome

B01CJU9MJI,I wonder if people read these,"I purchased a used version of the pixel 2 after having some bad luck with a refurbished original pixel. I can say that it was a great decision in that I saved hundreds of dollars and got a unit in excellent condition. The pixel 2 is a great smartphone and made numerous improvements over the original pixel. The cameras are my favorite part of this phone, they take amazing photos and I can't believe how professional the photos look when implementing portrait mode. They look like something straight out of a magazine. Low light environments still result in some graininess but the low light feature does help. Processing performance is impressive, I rarely see the system chug and I can carry out plenty of multitasking. The front facing speakers don't offer the cleanest sound but as someone who used to accidentally cover the speaker on the bottom of the original pixel I am a huge fan of the new speaker locations. The display is fine and I like the options to choose how much color saturation you desire. Active edge is a cool feature but I don't find myself using it very often. It requires a good deal of force to activate and it often requires squeezes in multiple places to finally trigger the assistant. One of my gripes with this phone is that it is no longer compatible with Anyview Cast on my Hisense smart TV so I'll probably need to purchase a chromecast in the future if I want to do things such as screen mirroring to my 4k tv. I've read that it also no longer supports Miracast. The battery life is great and I always have plenty of battery left over at the end of the day with moderate usage. The fingerprint reader is super fast and located on the back of the device. The fingerprint is located in a place the feels very natural for my pointer finger to rest on.

B0BVX7D41W,Great picture,"Is the special a fun diversion if you like the Scream TV Series? It can be. Is it worth seven dollars to watch it? Absolutely not. No episode of this show is worth seven dollars. I enjoy Scream, but it's a popcorn show, and the writing this season has been really bad. For seven dollars, you can get much better popcorn. And I'm disappointed in Amazon for selling it at this price when it really should have been included in the S2 season pass.

Scream was renewed for a season 2 consisting of fourteen episodes. I bought the season pass for season 2 expecting those fourteen episodes. I think it's kind of a ripoff that since Scream decided to save two of those fourteen episodes for Halloween that Amazon has decided to charge for these two episodes separately and ask customers to pay almost half of what it would cost for the entire season elsewhere.

B00WN7L4IA,Was not able to use it for more than 4 ...,"I remember when the iphone came out and had a 3.5"" display and it seemed crazy big compared to the existing trend of smaller and smaller phones. Now the trend is to have bigger and bigger phones. I have a Galaxy Note 3 (5.7"") that I absolutely love. This phone bucks that trend with a high resolution, crystal clear, and vibrantly colored 4"" screen. The phone really feels small in my hand and back pocket. (I use it for my business line). But that's not a detractor. It's actually perfect as a second phone or a phone for a kid (just don't forget the microsd card for their games). The phone has a toned down version of LG's android ""skin"" and it is zippy fast, especially for a phone that goes for $80 on amazon. If you don't mind the screen size I would buy it in a minute. Just don't forget the case, this little bugger is SLIPPERY. I love it and a lot of times when I put my Galaxy Note 3 'to bed"" I will continue to surf on this phone while watching tv. Dual 1.2 ghz processors aren't the best specs, but they get the job done. I had a Samsung Galaxy Victory LTE before it, and it felt really sluggish and laborious to even swipe screens. The f3 does a great job at everything I throw at it. And did I mention the display was great? Battery power is excellent too as its battery is way bigger than any other prepaid phone I've seen. Hope this was helpful, just remember when you order a case make sure it's compatible with the VM720 because the t-mobile and metropcs versions are flat on the top and the virgin mobile is rounded, making some cases incompatible.

B09V12VJ21,better than raycons!!!,"I'm pretty new to the iem space, but here are my thoughts as someone who's used HD599s for 6 years.

The good: Sound quality is excellent.
They are surprisingly clear sounding for the price point. Not shout and not fatiguing to listen to. If you're not opposed to using an EQ, you can even get some really decent bass coming from these. They're fairly comfortable, but with a caveat for my ears, but I'll get to that in a bit. The cable they come with seems to be the standard Truthear cable, but it's quite nice and does the job well. Wraps really easily, too. The included eartips took some getting used to, but they're also quite comfortable. I use the narrow bore ones, or some springtips, depending on the situation.

The not so good:
So about that comfort. I can wear these for hours, but they angled shell does press up against my ear towards the back. I have to adjust it from time to time or my ear starts to get sore. They also stick out farther from the ear than something like the Aria, but these being hybrids, they need more internal space, so that makes sense.

B086FKHTLZ,Phenomenal Phone with Great Camera and Battery Life,"Like one of the other reviewer on this site, ""Ancher"", I initially could not get the phone to work.
I received my unit yesterday (Feb 20th), and went to AT&T store immediately, they were able to
set it up quickly and copy over contact and other info from my old phone. Then I noticed that it has no LTE or 4G signal.
The employee at AT&T store was not able to figure out why there is no mobile data network. The phone can receive and make calls, and SMS message also works, but just no internet. After about 1 hour, they gave up, and told me to contact Huawei. That was around 4PM. I went home and contact Huawei right away, the CS agent (her name is Marisa) spend close to 2 hours with me, trying out various stuff, including couple of factory reset, which wipes out stuff I moved over from old phone, still no connection. Wifi works, but just no internet. The option to enable 4G under mobile network menu couldn't be set to enable. They checked the IEMI number, everything seems to check out. In the end, she said to wait 24 hours, maybe it takes a little while for the new SIM card to register. Then I found the review on this site by ""Ancher"". I actually print out his review and took it with me when I visited AT&T store again. They were not sure what to take of that, but to their credit, they were willing to try the method mentioned by ""Ancher"". One of their employee swap my SIM card with his iPhone8's. Both were able to connect to LTE quickly, we played around with some website for a short while, then switched the SIM cards back, and just like I have hoped, my Mate 10 Pro suddenly had no problem with connecting to 4G LTE network.

The phone is beautiful, and camera is amazing, but I wish I didn't have to go through this to get it to work. In the end, neither AT&T, nor Huawei was able to fix the problem.

B0BYPLCFDS,Failed after 2 months,"This is the nicest TV I've ever owned in my 40+ years on this planet. My last TV was a 42""1080p, which was decent, but this thing is on a whole other level!

The picture on this thing is so good! My cable TV only lets me get decent picture, but when I turn on my Xbox Series X and play a 4k game or watch a DVD or downloaded video I get to see what this thing is capable of, and I love it! I don't see any problems with it at all. I'm not a videophile or expert, but when I saw a random comment here and there about a random thing being a small issue with their TV I tried to recreate the same thing and never got anything that would ever remotely qualify as a problem. Maybe I'm just not sensitive enough, but to me this TV is pretty much perfect.

One of the nicest surprises of the TV is the sound it puts out! I was kind of expecting decent sound because I've seen that some modern TVs (like my last one) have what is essentially like a little mini soundbar built into the bottom of the TV when they're big enough. Since my last 42"" sounded good I hoped this would too. Well I was NOT disappointed! The sound is really clear, and gets more than loud enough for my small living room (20'x30'). I have never turned it up past 40 and I'm pretty sure it goes up to 100. It's not going to shake the house or make your ears bleed since there's no sub woofer or anything, but for a TV I can't help but to be impressed.

Actually, not only is there good sound coming from the bottom of the TV, but Sony seems to have done some kind of magic with speakers mounted in the back on the side of the TV up towards the top. These things can throw sound around the room and create a kind of surround sound. I don't know how they do it, because there isn't even a speaker grill or anything back there, the sound just comes through the plastic. I only noticed because I was standing next to it and heard them. It's a cool feature I wasn't expecting.

As I sit here typing this I have the TV on and I'm sitting in a menu for Forza Motorsport. The sounds of the menu music really seem like they're coming from the sides, and even behind me a little bit. The sound from this TV really impresses me. More than a few times since I bought it I'll think I hear something outside to my left, but it's just the TV doing it's thing. It's great!

One thing to note is that this TV is heavy. I believe the box said 70lbs when it was delivered. I have it mounted on the wall and I needed a friend to help me so I didn't risk breaking anything. So if you see the listed weight on here and think that other TVs are so much lighter and easy to pick up so it must be a typo, it isn't. This thing is so much heavier than I thought it would be.

I know there are better TVs out there, but they cost a lot more. I believe Sony pushed the tech in this kind of TV about as far as they can, and in my opinion they did an amazing job. It isn't the latest and greatest, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this TV. If you're on the fence, do it! I think you'll be happy. You've probably done enough research to be where you're wondering if you should pull the trigger. Well I think you should. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'm so happy I bought this thing! I'll update if anything changes, but part of the reason I bought this is because Sony is supposed to build TVs that last much longer than others. We'll see.

B081RVP56T,"Great quality, wish the button wasn't so stiff","I actually received two similar products to review - the Soundpeats TrueShift and a similar product called Dudios Zeus Ace. While I received the products at almost no charge, this will not affect my review and the comparison between the two is interesting.

First, both this unit, the SoundPeats TrueShift, and Dudios Zeus Ace come nicely packaged and the products feel sturdy, including the battery back-up unit they recharge in when not being used. While you may be excited to immediately pull out one or both earpieces from the charger when they arrive, resist the temptation and think about how you plan to use them first! There are two ways both systems can be used and how you remove them from the charger and pair them will determine how they operate. You can either use them as:

Independent Mono units: If you simply plan to use these to answer phone calls, this is the way to effectively have two independent headsets so you can double the use time by using them one at a time. To pair them you remove the right unit, pair it with your phone, then pull the left unit out and do the same. Since both have microphones you can use them one at a time.

Stereo: If you want to use these for music / video / gaming, which most probably do, the pairing proceedure is different. You remove both of the earpieces simultaneously and they will pair together first, then, after they have paired together you pair the Right side only with your phone. Now you will have stereo and you can use them on a call as well. However, if paired in stereo and then only have one earpiece in use while the other is in the charger, it works but you will get an annoying beep every few seconds as one earpiece is searching for the other.

So consider how you want to use these primarily before you pair them because they do not switch between stereo and independent mono use automatically. To change from one to the other, you would have to unpair everything and start all over.

With that said, while both units work quite well overall and the sound quality for voice calls is remarkably good - others couldn't tell I was on a bluetooth unit even with the microphone being next to the ear - this Soundpeats TrueShift would get my nod as the better of the two. The reasons are:

Pros:
> Battery:: I haven't had a problem with either, but both the internal battery and charger for this unit are larger and therefore will provide more overall time before recharging. Note, however, that this makes both the headset and the charger, in particular, larger. But the headsets are only marginally larger and since both chargers are to big to fit in a pocket and it would need to go into a backpack / briefcase anyway, the extra size becomes irrelevant to me.
> Musical Sound Quality: Both units are fine for voice conversations, whether listening or speaking, and both would be clear enough for video and gaming. The SoundPeats TrueShift, however, is a bit smoother and has a broader range. One specific difference that I note is that when I use an equalizer app on my phone and turn up the bass, the Dudios Zeus Ace units bottom out and buzz where the SoundPeats TrueShift distorts far less until really pushed hard. I am not a gamer and watch few videos, but I do like to listen to music so this may be the most important difference for me.

Neutral or possibly Con:
> Out of the box the Dudios Zeus Ace units fit more comfortably and easily than the TrueShift units. Especially because the TrueShift units are a little larger, the fit is quite important so that they feel secure when being worn. Fortunately, the supplied ear buds took care of this and I have not had any problem with the fit or feeling they were secure for normal use. (I don't do treadmills, so I cannot comment on exercising with them!)

Overall, for what I plan to use them for - phone calls and music - they are both remarkably capable. I have been using Bluetooth headsets for years from Jabra, Ant, Jawbone, AfterShokz and other SoundPeat units but since having these I haven't used anything else. I keep one set in my office (the Dudios Zeus Ace since they are primarily for calls) and the other at home (primarily for music). While you may not want to splurge on two complete sets like this, it is nice to know that if you wanted to do so, it would still cost far less than one set of AirPods!",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019",JoMart,Verified Purchase,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B081RVP56T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2,"SoundPEATS Ear Buds Wireless Bluetooth 5.1 Earbuds, IPX8 Waterproof Wireless Headphones 30Hrs Playtime Stereo in-Ear Headphones, Clear Call True Wireless Earbuds, Comfortable Fit, Touch Control, USB-C",Visit the SoundPEATS Store,4.2 out of 5 stars,"About this item[Ingenious Design and Relaxing Fit] The wireless earbud contains laser-engraved leather texture and has ergonomic design blended with metal elements which maintains balance between elegance and relaxation.

works but you will get an annoying beep every few seconds as one earpiece is searching for the other so consider how you want to use these primarily before you pair them because they do not switch between stereo and independent mono use automatically to change from one to the other you would have to unpair everything and start all over with that said while both units work quite well overall and the sound quality for voice calls is remarkably good others couldnt tell i was on a bluetooth unit even with the microphone being next to the ear this soundpeats trueshift would get my nod as the better of the two the reasons are pros battery i havent had a problem with either but both the internal battery and charger for this unit are larger and therefore will provide more overall time before recharging note however that this makes both the headset and the charger in particular larger but the headsets are only marginally larger and since both chargers are to big to fit in a pocket and it would need to go into a backpack briefcase anyway the extra size becomes irrelevant to me musical sound quality both units are fine for voice conversations whether listening or speaking and both would be clear enough for video and gaming the soundpeats trueshift however is a bit smoother and has a broader range one specific difference that i note is that when i use an equalizer app on my phone and turn up the bass the dudios zeus ace units bottom out and buzz where the soundpeats trueshift distorts far less until really pushed hard i am not a gamer and watch few videos but i do like to listen to music so this may be the most important difference for me neutral or possibly con out of the box the dudios zeus ace units fit more comfortably and easily than the trueshift units especially because the trueshift units are a little larger the fit is quite important so that they feel secure when being worn fortunately the supplied ear buds took care of this and i have not had any problem with the fit or feeling they were secure for normal use i dont do treadmills so i cannot comment on exercising with them overall for what i plan to use them for phone calls and music they are both remarkably capable i have been using bluetooth headsets for years from jabra ant jawbone aftershokz and other soundpeat units but since having these i havent used anything else i keep one set in my office the dudios zeus ace since they are primarily for calls and the other at home primarily for music while you may not want to splurge on two complete sets like this it is nice to know that if you wanted to do so it would still cost far less than one set of airpods,i actually received two similar products to review the soundpeats trueshift and a similar product called dudios zeus ace while i received the products at almost no charge this will not affect my review and the comparison between the two is interesting first both this unit the soundpeats trueshift and dudios zeus ace come nicely packaged and the products feel sturdy including the battery backup unit they recharge in when not being used while you may be excited to immediately pull out one or both earpieces from the charger when they arrive resist the temptation and think about how you plan to use them first there are two ways both systems can be used and how you remove them from the charger and pair them will determine how they operate you can either use them as independent mono units if you simply plan to use these to answer phone calls this is the way to effectively have two independent headsets so you can double the use time by using them one at a time to pair them you remove the right unit pair it with your phone then pull the left unit out and do the same since both have microphones you can use them one at a time stereo if you want to use these for music video gaming which most probably do the pairing proceedure is different you remove both of the earpieces simultaneously and they will pair together

B084Q24BYJ,Samsung Puts Out Great Products,"The best priced tv I've ever found, and lasts. I bought a 32"" for teen ager #1 a few years ago. Then bought a 46""for the living room. Then upgraded to a 50"" , so kid #2 took the former LR tv for his room. Now I have a 32"" that I use for a computer monitor, because... it's so much easier to see than a laptop screen. :)
Incredibly simple to set up the tv, then I plugged in the HDMI cord, and BOOM. Done.
The 32"" was $150. A computer monitor costs more than that. I had TWO monitors that crapped out, and then it dawned on me that I can get an actual tv for less, and I can watch lots of streaming channels on it if I want, and STILL bigger than the monitor.

B08CRY42NG,Good product,"I've had the Google pixel 3XL for several months now and have really enjoyed it; this may even be my favorite phone thus far (and I've had 6 phones over the last 2 years, most being major flagship models). It feels super thin and lightweight, but SUPER durable - my screen is scratch-free (and I don't use a screen protector!), and this phone has survived not just getting dropped A LOT - after missing for 4 days, it was found outside under bricks after days of storms! I wiped the mud off, plugged it in and it worked perfectly (and still does!). The 6.3 inch screen is big, bright and vibrant, with excellent screen-to-body ratio. I've gotten used to the black ""notch"" that drops down about half an inch at the top because it allows for a great ear speaker and an awesome front camera. Pictures are sharp and portrait mode does an excellent job of putting the face in focus and softening the appearance of imperfections. I've also been very impressed with battery life - I can go a full day on a single charge and haven't noticed any decrease in battery life. I just started using a wireless charger, which works great even with a protective case.

I read reviews that complained about no microSD or headphone jack, but there's plenty of storage space, and the box includes a headphone jack adapter to resolve that issue (although you're unable to charge the device while using headphones).

As always, Amazon shipped my package quickly with next-day delivery and customer service was extremely helpful answering my questions about Amazon warehouse and item specifics. Very satisfied!

It's not picture perfect out the box, at least my model wasn't. It was too bright and too sharp. Now she's perfect, so you've got to tinker with it. And it doesn't get hot like the G3, which I was able to find out in the store. The remote is fun to use, as it's a magic cursor like the option on the PS4 controller. Be sure to use the option to go back to the last input so the TV comes on immediately without having to go thru the Home screen; most people will want the TV to just come on, not the web features.

B07GBRB3SC,uses,We have had the phone way under 1 year. This phone is SUPPOSED to hold a 1 year manufacturing warranty on it. When you buy this phone they tell you to NEVER REMOVE the screen cover on the inside of this phone. It will void your warranty if you do. You also can not put a screen protector of this. That does not seem like a problem up front. The regular opening and closing of the phone causes damage to the screen. It starts as a crease in the screen protector and than once it is damaged it starts to make a black line in the cent of the phone. With in hours this black line widens and causes other color damages to the screen color that push up. You can no longer fold the phone closed at this point as it continues to spread everytime you do. Because of this debris gets in the crack at this point. When you contact Samsung they send you to a THIRD PARTY to evaluate the product. There they will not help at all if there is any debris around the screen or in that crack even if it is just on the screen PROTECTOR and not the screen. The reason for is they say yes you are right this is a manufactor issue but when we honor it and send your phone in samsung says we should not honor anything that affects the original screen protector so we get stuck with the phones balance fee on us. There for they wont even touch this phone. When we went to our phone company for this issue they worked with us for over 2 HOURS....They argued with the insurance claims stating it was indeed a manufactor issue.....HOWEVER because it is damage to the screen it is our fault for the damage taking place when WE OPEN AND CLOSE THE PHONE....LOL....isnt that what the phone is supposed to do? Yet that is our fault. The phone company said they see this issue DAILY. We sadly bought it through best buy to save money rather than the phone company. Our phone company apologized but stated they do not ever recommend this phone anymore because of this and had we bought it there they would have done everything in our power to discourage it. The recommended us not waste money on the almost $300 insurance claim fee as it will MOST CERTAINALY happen again on a replacement and that we should not be charged for a manufactures defect that falls under warranty.

B00OL4DEMC,great phone,"This is a great Android phone. The only drawback seems to be the camera, which I haven't used much. If you use your phone primarily as a camera then buy an iPhone (or a camera). If you want a fast Android phone that has a sharp screen and is easy to use 1-handed then this phone combined with T-Mobile's $30 a month prepaid plan is the most economical way to go. Their LTE service is as fast as high speed cable internet and works much better inside buildings than their older HSPA+ 4G did. This is a quad core phone that is nano-coated to resist water at a bargain price.

Avoid the Sandisk Ultra Class 10 SD cards, though. There are a lot of people finding these to be incompatible with this particular phone.

B0BP21J3FN,Buen producto,"I kept watch when the price would go down to purchase these, and I'm glad I did because they are nowhere near worth the original price. The main reason why I kept this product and didn't return them was because of their color and how they are easier to hide with my hair down than Apple AirPods. Aesthetically pleasing look overcame all the cons for me. So Kimberly, great job on selecting nude colors for beats to produce.

Noise cancellation was not what I was expecting either. 6/10. I have to push them into my ears to get mediocre sound quality. BUT, once I do have them placed in my ear to where they won't fall off. I was watching a podcast with both earpieces in and got spooked by the spatial audio feature. I felt like I was in a movie theatre and everyone could hear what I was listening to. After owning them for 6 months, I was finally impressed with the quality.

My biggest issue with these is when I pause my music, all I hear is a low hum of static. It's like some type of sound has to be playing for these to not make that annoying sound.

Battery life lasts more than I expected. Longer than my previous Airpod Pros 1st gen did.

B09RMND29B,Great TV so far,"On paper, it sounds like something that only a complete idiot could have come up with: reinvent a kind of played out movie series from the nineties into a modern TV show on MTV all the while incorporating things (social media, viral videos) that the original didn't have because a.) it was too early for it and b.) because it would've made the killer so much easier to catch if he'd been a constant braggart. Where this show succeeds, and even somehow surpasses the original, is that it never really tries to take itself seriously. In the very first episode, for example, a character actually calls out the very premise of the show for being unoriginal and kind of dumb because ""slasher movies can't be TV shows"" and then actually explains, in great detail, why the whole thing would collapse under its own pretenses. Yet, despite this rather large hill to climb, Scream the TV series actually manages to be both endearing and brilliant in its own way. The humor is occasionally funny, the characters are well-rounded and (for the most part) likeable, the plotline works more often than not and it even has the guts to stick to the whole gory side of a horror story (there's plenty of blood in this thing). All in all, a great time with a few breakout performances and a plotline any horror fan can get behind. Unfortunately, while all of these things work great in tandem, neither season really manages to stick the ending. Both killer reveals are completely predictable from the third episode onward, neither has anything outside of the actors portraying the killers being the polar opposite of the character you've seen the entire season and the show never really seems to be willing to pull the trigger on a bigger part of the cast (Audrey, Emma, Brooke, Keiren and Noah are practically immortal in this series). While these are minor problems on an otherwise 90% good to awesome show, it does kind of make me sad that the writers never seemed to know what to do when it was finally time to actually REVEAL a secret rather than set it up. Still, it's a fun time that's sure to entertain for those ten episodes or so until you have to suffer through the ending.

B00G1FLDJA,My favorite show. I watch every night getting ready to ...,"This book was highly recommended by some HH fans, but I didn't find a whole lot to it. Perhaps in years gone by, this sort of compilation was the only source of information, but these days, the Hogan's Heroes wiki, etc. has most of what's in this book.

Here's how it breaks down:

First 17% contains background about the series' creation, Campo 44, etc. This was the only part I found valuable and so for $6.87, it seems overpriced.

The next 23% (counting by Kindle numbering) has cast profiles. A little deeper than Wikipedia articles but for each actor there are pages of info on other credits. The film/TV is on IMDB. Theater, etc. is not.

The last 60% of this book is wasted because they're episode summaries. All of the info is available online and in much greater detail.

If you're a die-hard fan...it might be a worthwhile read. In fact, I think it's the only book on Hogan's Heroes. Just be advised that you're getting a lot of reference material that is online and it's overpriced due to that.

B09X7G4FT4,Difficulties in transferring pictures and other apps.,"I was deliberating whether to buy the Galaxy Nexus or wait for the next version to come out. I'm happy I went with this phone. The new Nexus 4 was just announced, and while it is a bit of an upgrade, I needed a phone quickly, so I couldn't wait three weeks for the Nexus 4. The Galaxy Nexus is living up to the hype so far. The version I received is the pure Google version, not a Japanese Docomo phone, as many people have reported. Mine came from Worldwide Distributors, fwiw. Within minutes it received an OTA update to Jellybean, the latest version of Android, and I'm sure when Android 4.2 comes out in the next few weeks, it will get that too.
I previously had a Motorola Triumph with Virgin Mobile. That phone was laggy and often unresponsive. It began randomly rebooting once every few days after I'd had it for a year. My new Galaxy Nexus is super-responsive, clear, and full-featured. I switched over to T-mobile's prepaid plan, and I'm not looking back. This phone is 3G, but works on T-mo's ""4G"" network (i.e., HSPA+). I checked network speeds today using the Speedtest app, and had 4.8 MB dl & 1.8 MB upload speeds. It's not true 4G, but it's much faster than my old VM service. I'm using GrooveIP with my Google Voice number and making outgoing calls over the data network, which is working great, and I'm not using any of my very limited mobile minutes.
If you haven't used Android 4.1, it's a very nice OS. I'm using the new Google Now feature quite a bit. You can swipe up from the bottom of the homescreen or lockscreen to get to it. Google Now consists of a set of customized cards, each with relevant information (next appointment, sports scores, directions, weather, etc.). I especially like that the OS gives me reminders for my next appointment, and even estimates my travel time to get there, alerting me a few minutes early so that I have time to travel. And it's nice that it's automatic.
I run with my phone, and use Runtastic to track my progress. My old Motorola Triumph was horrible at getting a GPS lock (well known fault of that phone). This one locks within seconds, and I'm off. I use Stitcher Radio at the same time to listen to podcasts or Spotify for music, and it works seamlessly.
Best of all, I've been pleasantly surprised by the battery life. I got used to plugging my Triumph into my car charger while on the road, or plugging it in while at work, so it wouldn't run out of juice by the end of the day. The Galaxy Nexus seems to last all day for me, so when I plug it in at 11 p.m., it still had 40% power left. This is with the stock battery, and moderate usage. Obviously high-power users won't get that much life out of it, but it works great for me.
I was wary of moving up to a bigger phone, since my 4"" Triumph seemed to be a good size. The size of the GNex is great, however. It's thin enough to slide in my pocket, and the slight curve to the screen glass actually seems to make it fit better. I put it in a Cruzerlite TPU case, and that adds a little bulk, but not much. I was going to go straight out and buy a big battery after reading reviews here, but I'm glad I didn't. Some of those batteries really add thickness to the phone, and I'm getting good battery life out of the stock battery (which also has NFC, which I haven't used yet).
If you're thinking about this phone or the Nexus 4, you might want to wait a couple of weeks until the Nexus 4 is available. It has a quadcore processor (this one's dualcore), a higher resolution screen (the GNex is great though), and a few more bells and whistles. Neither the Nexus 4 nor this GNex has a micro-SD slot, which is a bit of a downside in my book. I'd love to be able to put a 32GB (or 64GB!) card in my phone and completely replace my mp3 player (a Zune HD - which I still love after 3 years of heavy use!). But if you have a pretty good data network, you might find that streaming media from the cloud will work for you - it does for me so far. Plus, I like having a dedicated music player, even if it is one more thing to carry around.
So I have no regrets with this phone.

B095CCMRRW,Nice sound!,"First if all, the headphones arrived in a nice box and also had a few cool things in the box as well. I really loved the headphones for the first couple of days. Now after 2 weeks of wearing them everyday. My feelings have changed a little. After you wear the headphones for a while. They start hurting your ears. They also loose there shape some. I believe that's why my ears hurt. Also, the up and down volume is a pain. It takes a little while to get used to them. I am always turning the down instead if up. The clip that comes with them is kind if cheesy. I have lost mine already. After working out and sweating in them a few times the color is distorted a little. Also, loses signal a lot.

B0BCF3YGGF,Phone not unlocked like it was supposed to be,"As an owner of the original Galaxy Note, let me just start by saying most of the issues or ""annoyances"" felt in version 1 have been ironed out in version 2.

Everything is better with the Note 2. The speed of this thing is awesome. Windows fly open with easy and smoothness, faster screen switching and all around a more solid feel in the operating system. It is hard to describe. I highly recommend just playing with one at the stores and you will instantly feel its awesomeness.

Love the extra features, multi-tasking (although I hope future versions support all apps), better S Note capabilities and touch/feel. This thing takes stunning photos and videos. Love all the new photo add-ons....voice activating the shot by saying ""Cheese!"" is killer. Photo buffs will love all the new Android 4.1 features.

Everything shown on the screen is literally breathtaking. All my friends are jealous when I show it to them. Take that tiny iPhone! Battery life is awesome, my biggest complaint regarding the Note 1.

Note: Rooting! I rooted my phone, but user beware. If you root this phone, mine stopped getting updates via Kies and the phone's update system. I had to get download of the latest international firmwares, and install it manually. Not hard, and ensures you are always up to date. If doing this, make sure you write down your current Baseband and Build number in Settings/About Device section and get the latest available build that matches the country code. Google it. I highly recommend backing up your current ROM/firmware if you do any rooting.

B0BHQ4ND28,Battery life is not the best,"Before I dive into my thoughts on the product, here's a bit of insight into my personal needs and usage to set the stage. There were a few requirements that the next pair of wireless headphones I bought needed to fulfill:

- Bluetooth
- Lightweight
- Good sound with noticeable bass
- Decent microphone for phone calls
- Needs the ability to stay in my ear
- Durable
- Good battery life
- No over-the-head band

With these requirements, my options became somewhat limited. Every pair I looked at the reviews for there was always something wrong that turned me off. From durability issues to ear bud problems to just poor sound. This pair is no exception, the reviews are mixed (at leas there on Amazon). I'm coming from LG Tone Pros that worked well but suffered from poor bass and the inability to stay in my ears when doing anything with movement (even eating a bowl of cereal while listening to something on those caused the buds to fall out). I had high standards that needed to be met.

I purchased the Bose SoundSport Wireless over other products like Beats3 and such, but not for reasons people think. I purchased it on a gamble from the recommendation of my wife who has used several Bose products in the past and generally has been content. The packaging for the headphones was about what you would expect. Good box setup with ease of access to everything you need. It comes with a charging cable, 3 sets of buds (one set already on the headphones, with 2 sets in a plastic bag), the buds themselves, among other lesser important items.

When trying the pair on for the first time, I noticed that the mid-size buds were not the right size. I swapped out for the larger buds and found it fit well. I proceeded to shake my head and run around to try and shake the buds loose. I'm glad to say they didn't budge. The wing tips for the buds work great, however the real test will come when hitting the gym or workout session. Unfortunately, I've yet to try it in a workout session.

So far I've used these buds while at work and home for daily, leisure use. The longest period of time I've had these on was approximately 6 hours while sitting at work. The battery varies slightly between 7 to 9 hours for me, but that also includes breaks and periods of time where I turn off my headphones while working. I started experiencing some discomfort at about the 4 hour mark where I had to pull out the buds for a few minutes before placing them back into my ear.

As far as sound goes, I was impressed. Clear, crisp overall sound with good amount of bass. Unlike the Tone Pros where the bass was almost non-existent, I can hear the bass loudly and clearly that makes listening to some of my rock songs feel like an experience in comparison. I also used these buds to watch movies, tv shows and random youtube videos and it definitely sounds better. I'm no audiophile, but I've tested and used my share of headphones and the sound is high quality with the Bose SoundSports.

Another minor issue with the buds is the clip that's attached to the wire part. It is there to keep your buds attached to your shirt so they don't fall from your neck when not using the buds and to keep the wire from moving too much while using the pair. This clip, while does its job well, isn't attached very well to the wire. It's easy to pull off and in my case, has fallen off without me noticing. My wife found it once in the bed after I used it for an hour while laying down watching a tv show. The clip isn't necessary too much, however does provide some comfort so you don't have to keep readjusting the wire around your neck.

Just a little insert here, the mic quality is fine. I've gotten no complaints from family and friends that I've talked to about issues hearing me or disconnections. Not much to say as I've had very limited time with phone calling in the 2 weeks I've own this. I will update this part in the future if I run into any problems.

Just a last bit here, the connectivity to my phone and other electronic devices is easy. When I power on the device, a voice comes over stating how much power is remaining in percentages, then proceeds to say which devices (by name) it is trying to connect to. For example, my pair says its trying to connect to FRISINA-PC and will say each letter out since it doesn't know how to pronounce the name. I'm able to have the buds connected to multiple devices at once (at one point it was connected to my phone and laptop at the same time) and will attempt to connect to any previously connected devices after powering on. When connecting to the device for the first time, it was as simple as turning on the power, listening for ""ready to connect"" voice and then finding the buds on the device I'm trying to connect. There's nothing else to it.

Overall, the Bose SoundSport Earbuds fit what I was looking for in my requirements and it is my go to headphones now when I'm not at my computer (I use a SteelSeries Arctis 7 for gaming and general use while on my desktop). I highly recommend this pair if you're like and have trouble finding something to fit your ears. As simple as the ""technology"" is, the wing tips change everything. A solid 4 star buds, the minor discomfort, clip issues, and unsure battery life keep a star off for now. I will be updating down the line if I have more to add.",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2017",billybop,Verified Purchase,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0BHQ4ND28/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3,"SoundPEATS True Wireless Earbuds, Air3 Deluxe HS Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones with 14.2mm Driver, 4 Mic Hi-Res Audio Wireless Ear Buds, IPX4 Waterproof Stereo in-Ear Earphones, 20Hrs, in-Ear Detection",Visit the SoundPEATS Store,4.4 out of 5 stars,"About this itemTop Notch Service - Your happiness is our top priority, if you encounter any issues with Bluetooth earbuds, you don't need to apply to return the product, prioritize reaching us directly through any available channel, like via Amazon message, our SoundPEATS official customer services are here to assist you, and we'll do our best to resolve the issue to your satisfaction.Hi-res Audio Certification - CNET- ""Best Earbuds of 2022.""

with noticeable bass decent microphone for phone calls needs the ability to stay in my ear durable good battery life no overthehead band with these requirements my options became somewhat limited every pair i looked at the reviews for there was always something wrong that turned me off from durability issues to ear bud problems to just poor sound this pair is no exception the reviews are mixed at leas there on amazon im coming from lg tone pros that worked well but suffered from poor bass and the inability to stay in my ears when doing anything with movement even eating a bowl of cereal while listening to something on those caused the buds to fall out i had high standards that needed to be met i purchased the bose soundsport wireless over other products like beats and such but not for reasons people think i purchased it on a gamble from the recommendation of my wife who has used several bose products in the past and generally has been content the packaging for the headphones was about what you would expect good box setup with ease of access to everything you need it comes with a charging cable sets of buds one set already on the headphones with sets in a plastic bag the buds themselves among other lesser important items when trying the pair on for the first time i noticed that the midsize buds were not the right size i swapped out for the larger buds and found it fit well i proceeded to shake my head and run around to try and shake the buds loose im glad to say they didnt budge the wing tips for the buds work great however the real test will come when hitting the gym or workout session unfortunately ive yet to try it in a workout session so far ive used these buds while at work and home for daily leisure use the longest period of time ive had these on was approximately hours while sitting at work the battery varies slightly between to hours for me but that also includes breaks and periods of time where i turn off my headphones while working i started experiencing some discomfort at about the hour mark where i had to pull out the buds for a few minutes before placing them back into my ear as far as sound goes i was impressed clear crisp overall sound with good amount of bass unlike the tone pros where the bass was almost nonexistent i can hear the bass loudly and clearly that makes listening to some of my rock songs feel like an experience in comparison i also used these buds to watch movies tv shows and random youtube videos and it definitely sounds better im no audiophile but ive tested and used my share of headphones and the sound is high quality with the bose soundsports another minor issue with the buds is the clip thats attached to the wire part it is there to keep your buds attached to your shirt so they dont fall from your neck when not using the buds and to keep the wire from moving too much while using the pair this clip while does its job well isnt attached very well to the wire its easy to pull off and in my case has fallen off without me noticing my wife found it once in the bed after i used it for an hour while laying down watching a tv show the clip isnt necessary too much however does provide some comfort so you dont have to keep readjusting the wire around your neck just a little insert here the mic quality is fine ive gotten no complaints from family and friends that ive talked to about issues hearing me or disconnections not much to say as ive had very limited time with phone calling in the weeks ive own this i will update this part in the future if i run into any problems just a last bit here the connectivity to my phone and other electronic devices is easy when i power on the device a voice comes over stating how much power is remaining in percentages then proceeds to say which devices by name it is trying to connect to for example my pair says its trying to connect to frisinapc and will say each letter out since it doesnt know how to pronounce the name im able to have the buds connected to multiple devices at once at one point it was connected to my phone and laptop at the same time and will attempt to connect to any previously connected devices after powering on when connecting to the device for the first time it was as simple as turning on the power listening for ready to connect voice and then finding the buds on the device im trying to connect theres nothing else to it overall the bose soundsport earbuds fit what i was looking for in my requirements and it is my go to headphones now when im not at my computer i use a steelseries arctis for gaming and general use while on my desktop i highly recommend this pair if youre like and have trouble finding something to fit your ears as simple as the technology is the wing tips change everything a solid star buds the minor discomfort clip issues and unsure battery life keep a star off for now i will be updating down the line if i have more to add,0,Negative,1,2

B09JL41N9C,The Fits fit,"I previously owned AirPod Pros and always had issues with fitment. They’d fall out laying in bed. They’d fall out chewing while eating lunch. They’d fall out while going for a run or exercising. AirPods just do not fit me at all.

This year I’ve been running a lot more and it was the final straw. I needed ear buds that would actually stay in my ears so I could focus on my workout. That’s when I took the leap and bought the Beats Fit Pros.

They fit my ear perfectly. I’d say my ears are on the larger side because these ear buds sit in my without any discomfort. There was no break in period at all. They feel just right. If you have medium to large ears and are looking for ear buds to workout in, these are the ones.

B00D99DHH2,For just phone calls it's great.,"My phone had just passed it's warranty and right before a big trip the camera stopped working. Trouble shooted with customer support thinking it was a software issue but seems to be hardware because a few times it worked when I squeezed the phone around the camera. So I'm thinking loose connection. Took it to a repair shop and they opened it up and tested the connection which was fine but the camera still doesn't work. Contacted Sony thinking $50 would be worth it to fix the camera only to discover it will cost between $150 and $250 to fix. A $500 phone shouldn't have problems that cost that much to fix at the 1 year mark. I really liked this phone because it is smaller than all the others and I could easily hold it and put it in my pocket and although the phone and apps still work I have to have the camera for my work. So now I have a $500 piece of junk. :-( I also read that other people had the same problem with the camera which is how I discovered putting pressure on the phone around the camera can help it work temporarily.

Well. Almost a week later I can’t afford to replace them so I’m going without; when we decide why not. Let’s go look for them.

B08XJVZT4R,Es muy buen celular 📱,"I've had it for a few days and spent several hours trying to make it usable as my sole daily phone. Everybody has different uses and lifestyles, so it's good to have options in the market for phones, which are pocket computers and the subset of computers they fit into is tablets, just a touchscreen interface. So a phone is just the small size range of tablets. They are general purpose computers that could be used for endless purposes in endless styles.

For my own personal purposes, I prefer to use a laptop/tablet as much as possible and I have very little use for voice calls or texting on a phone. I avoid voice calls as much as possible and I found some good options to handle SMS/texting on my laptop/tablet instead of my phone--the best one seems to be Google Messages, but I've also had good results with Pushbullet and there are others.

So here's what I want a phone to do primarily:
--camera, taking photos/videos, mostly for practical documentation, not to win NatGeo contests
--voice recording for voice memos
--voice input for typing
--timers, alarms, stopwatch, clock
--music/audio playback, battery info for earbuds

And here's what I don't need a phone to do usually, maybe once in a while at most:
--phone calls
--texting, emailing, messaging in general, text input in general
--video playback or editing
--web browsing
--social media

So basically I'm in an extreme minority of people who don't want to use phones the way they're commonly used, but I don't want a dumbphone and I'm not trying to reduce my phone usage; I'm trying to actually increase my phone usage by making a phone a more useful tool based on its portability and convenience. Amazingly, people are still buying tiny clip-on mp3 players these days, which are a huge advantage over phones for audio playback while exercising. Before I started using smartphones about 6 years ago, I was an avid user of Sansa Clip. But it really doesn't make any sense to have a single-purpose device like that with huge compromises on screens, firmware, software, etc. It makes way more sense to have a regular smartphone that's shrunk into the smallest usable form factor.

So Jelly 2 is pretty close to that, although the Palm phone is actually much closer because it's half the size and weight of Jelly 2. I had a hard time choosing between Palm and Jelly 2. I got the Jelly 2 because of the more up-to-date software, better specs on the processor and memory, and because the customizable side button seemed like a killer feature. But I'm not happy to have a device that's twice the size and weight as it could be just for the sake of longer battery life. That doesn't make any sense, because there are lots of great tiny powerbanks available to recharge as needed. You can buy a tiny powerbank and a Palm phone and have the same battery life and convenience as a larger built-in battery, but in many usage scenarios it's a big advantage to not have that extra size and weight on the phone itself. People who complain about the Palm battery life are missing the point and maybe don't realize how many tiny powerbanks are easy and cheap to buy and easy to carry and use. Charging twice a day instead of once using a tiny powerbank that takes up hardly any space in a bag? Perfect solution instead of making the phone twice as big and heavy. So I might even switch to Palm in the future, but I'm testing the Jelly 2 for now and I love it.

The elephant in the room is text input. It's almost impossible to use this phone for typing with fingers. Part of that is a software problem because all the OSKs I've found so far use screen space inefficiently. There's a bunch of ""large button"" and alternative keyboard apps, but so far I haven't found one that solves the software problem nicely. Part of the problem is the inherent physical limitations of the device and the user's fingers. I have very large hands. I wear XL gloves. My fingers are not fat, but they're larger than average, so that's a big variable for different people. Tiny people with thin fingers have the best life. Food costs are lower and they can use smaller phones, among so many other advantages, not to go off-topic.

So typing with fingers is only a last-resort emergency operation with this phone. The other typing option is a capacitive stylus. I've found that to be dramatically better than fingers with Jelly 2, but still pretty bad. Once again, part of the problem is the software design of the OSK.

There is are 2 other ways to input text though: handwriting and voice. I've tested handwriting input with a capacitive stylus on Jelly 2 using Google Keep and Nebo. Basically it was a failure. No need to go into the details. It doesn't work. It works perfectly fine on any standard large phone even with a capacitive stylus, but the combo of small screen and coarse input of capacitive stylus makes this method unusable. Nebo is a very good app in general for drawing and handwriting input. I've had good impressions using it on my Windows laptop/tablet, which has an active stylus. And it seems great on a standard large phone, but it was basically useless when I tested it on Jelly 2.

So obviously the solution is an active stylus. I have always owned stylus phones, Samsung Note models and LG Stylo models. Active styluses are amazing, a total game-changer. They are incredibly precise and useful. The difference in usability between active and capacitive styluses is the difference between a sports car and a bicycle with flat tires. If Unihertz would make a Jelly model with active stylus, it would be worth any price they ask. I would happily pay double the price for that feature. It would completely transform the functionality of this phone. It would be a totally legitimate tool for text input.

The same applies to Palm. If they released a model with active stylus, I would switch to that in a heartbeat. Given the niche status of phones like these, it's not likely these companies can profit from an even more niche product, but I think once people start to discover that these types of phones even exist at all, they could become very popular. I just learned that tiny phones exist last week. I literally had never heard of them before and never even thought about the topic, and I'm a gadget-loving tech-geek type person who pays attention to a lot of things in the world. I really had no idea these phones existed. I suddenly had the idea one day that a tiny phone would be better because I really just want to do... the things I listed above. So then I went on the internet to look for tiny phones and discovered a whole new world, including all the cute, hilarious, cheap ""2G only"" micro-phones.

ACTIVE STYLUS PLEASE!

But there's another huge topic, which is voice typing. I never even tried that before, but I found it works great, like shockingly great. So for example, in Google Keep I can speak and see almost immediate transcriptions that are about 95% accurate in general, and the mistakes are pretty small and easy to ignore in most usage scenarios. It's a moderately mature technology. Unfortunately I don't think the technology is mature enough to handle the full variation in dialects that exist in the world. Just English alone has dozens of dialects with significant differences in pronunciation, so the voice recognition tech probably fails for a lot of people. I'm lucky because I speak a common dialect of English, although I don't have cot-caught merger but Keep seems to, and I've noticed some other failures on vowel recognition already in my brief testing of voice typing the past few days. I'm sure I have a lot to learn about that topic, but the bottom line is that voice typing is a viable solution for text input on Jelly 2, which basically rescues this device. Without that or an active stylus, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to justify using this instead of a standard larger phone. While text input is a low priority in my usage goals, it's still moderately important.

Congratulations to Unihertz for making an amazing product. The build quality is incredible. It feels like a premium device. It's beautiful and magnificent. I have high hopes for this as I find solutions on the software side--the whole experience of looking for apps and testing them is quite a nightmare and something I didn't really dabble in for my past phones. The phone did come with default built-in junk apps that can't be uninstalled, but a pretty small number and not a big deal. I found the solution is to use a third-party launcher/homescreen/icon customization app and then the icons can basically disappear.

But given my usage, the inferior specs of the Palm phone are probably more than adequate and so I'm still considering trying that in the future and switching. A major issue is actually the comfort in the hand, because if it's too thin it might be harder to hold. I'm mostly holding the Jelly in between my 1st and 4th fingers (if you indexed them without the thumb). I'm posting a photo of that there. I've found that by far the most comfortable, and it doesn't block the microphone, but holding it in landscape mode has also been very comfortable and despite blocking the mic it would be better for typing if I could find suitable keyboard software. Hopefully this paradigm of tiny phones will catch on and then companies will offer more choices to suit different people with all their different preferences and hand sizes.

ACTIVE STYLUS PLEASE!

By the way, I'm in the USA and already had a T-Mobile account. I simply swapped the SIM into Jelly 2 and it worked right away with no issues.

UPDATE: I found that the red side button meant for customization is extremely valuable. It's absolutely perfect for screenshots and for the camera. It has 3 modes: short press, long press, double press. I haven't found a use for the 3rd one yet, but for screenshots and camera, a separate ""physical"" button is ideal. With the camera now, I can hold it very securely with one hand and take photos with the same hand very comfortably, 100% one-handed, which is difficult, almost impossible, for me to do with a regular sized phone and the touchscreen button on the camera app. I don't know to what extent physical side buttons like power and volume can be custom programmed to take photos on typical phones, but when it's a combo press of some kind it can be pretty awkward to use. With this single side button on the middle of the side, it's simply perfect ergonomics with one hand. For screenshots, it's a big advantage to have a button that isn't on the screen, and my past experience has been bad with a screenshot button on the bottom row as a 4th dedicated touch button alongside home, back and window navigation. It was bad because I often accidentally pressed the button, which was very close to its neighbor. Not a huge deal, just lots of accidental screenshots.

But the red button doesn't work unless the phone is already on, so it's not especially useful for most purposes. If you have to press the power button first, then you can do almost anything just as easily with a normal touchscreen button. If you press the red button while the phone is off, nothing happens, so it's not a pure ""one button"" operation, but it's still extremely valuable for screenshots and photos.",5.0,"Reviewed in the

El producto llego antes de tiempo, tanto la caja como el producto intacto; tiene una resolucion de pantalla muy buena, tasa de refresco ideal, teclado muy comodo, la bateria podria mejorar pero pues no puedes pedir 100 de 100 en todo por este precio, rendimiento en juegos muy alto (Cyberpunk, GTA V, Breakpoint, GoG, Hitman WoA), super rapido para trabajos de diseño y renderizado.

La versión 2024 tiene un SSD de 1TB (Se agradece) pero es estandar, recomiendo cambiarlo por uno mas potente para aprovechar aun mas el rendimiento del equipo.

B07HFK5PQQ,Comes pre broken to save you time,"Not exactly what I thought I would get for something's that's over $200 but it seems more of a hassle to return it and get another one. The phone was unlocked, so far I have not had any issues with using tmobile for this phone. The phone did have some small issues the back of phone has a small crack, the power button did not seem very stable, and for some reason the battery will not charge to 100%. First the phone seems to take a lot longer than any other phone to charge and when I left it charging it would go from 92% and without touching it it goes to 87%( no app was being used). When I did use the Internet it appeared to be slower than the LG i had and heats up the battery fast, so I'm hoping it is just the battery and not the phone. So far I'm not very pleased with the purchase but I still have a few days to consider if I want to keep it or order from somewhere else. Only considering to keep the phone bc my old phone broke.

B09M6FWWLW,Eh,"1. Small to medium ears will experience a great fit. For large ears, meaning, ears with bigger openings, they won’t work at all because it’s the stem that holds them in place. For large ears, ear (1) will do the trick with foam tips.

2. Sound quality is just like the basic AirPods (not pro) and you get a bit of situational awareness when you have these on.

3. The case is just fantastic. The earbuds themselves look really nice. Nothing has really done something here with fresh design.

I also like that the actual monitor itself will unplug from the chord. I do plan on buying the wireless module as well from ZSN to use when I don't want to be plugged in.

B09S8BV4D9,En encantó,"Video recording is heating up an can only record few minutes in HD. If you used your phone before recording, it may not manage even that. 720p kinda works a little bit longer, but it still may cut you out (anything between 5 and 20 minutes, depending on the room temperature, initial phone temperature, fortune...).
Ordinary web browsing with occasional video will heat up the phone to extreme temperatures, especially if charging at the same time (you can not hold your hand pressed at the back of the phone, where the heat sweet spot is). Of course, as soon as the temperature gets high, speed goes down, as in crawling down.
On top of that there are annoying apps preinstalled by Sony (most can be disabled, but not all). Why would I want WhatsNew messages from Sony on a regular basis and why would anybody enjoy the fact that one cannot remove/disable this app (at least not easily).
Other than all of that, there is nothing worthy of mentioning (waterproof would be a plus, but Sony says not to put your phone underwater, so I say: no plus there).

B00V7FXCZ2,"No MicroSD slot, otherwise a great phone","I always had Samsung phones over the years then about a year or so ago I thought why not try a different manufacturer. It worked great at first then in time, it would freeze up and I couldn't do anything with it. Then it ran extremely slow, again nothing worked to fix it. I even did a search online and found out the manufacturer admitted these problems and gave step by step directions to ""hopefully"" fix it. But...it only worked for a day or so that was it. Then about a month or two ago, it started just shutting off. no matter what I did, it would not turn back on, it even had a full battery. Sometimes it would take four or more hours before I would just try it again and it would turn on. Once this started being a regular problem it left me no choice but to get another phone. With my cell phone history, the smartest thing to do was to go back to the one manufacturer that NEVER gave me a problem, Samsung!! It's not the latest model but it has more bells and whistles any of my phones ever had!! I always had to download apps for different things like night vision camera, this phone has it as well as a number of other special lens type filters. The camera on this phone take the most beautiful photos I've ever seen from a cell phone before. The photos are vibrant and bold. There are at least 12 different settings to try. The display, has a blue light filter for eye strain, a night mode also.It also has edge panels which I love. It keeps your screen clear of apps you use! The sound on this phone is awesome!! It also has different settings, concert hall is one of them!! It just comes with so many different options, like face recognition, register your irises, fingerprints, voice assistant...I could go on and on!!.Oh and it comes with one of the BEST headsets I've ever seen to date!!!! If you record music, you will love it!! It also has a wonderful large screen!! The only advice I will offer is to get at least 64MG of memory, it makes a difference with any phone...If you're looking for a great phone this is definitely one to consider!!

B07NZXXZB2,Súper rápido y gran capacidad,"This is a sharp looking phone. It is the only phone I have ever owned, including the previous galaxies where people have inquired about it because of it's looks. The fingerprint sensor works really well for me and the face recognition is very convenient. My main downside is the software, which might be on Samsung or might be on Android. Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. One excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously. Not sure if this is a google account feature but kudos to whomever.

Camera: Excellent
Battery: So far, excellent. I don't use my phone like crazy but without any battery saving mode I still have at least 30% left at the end of the day.
Screen: Really, really fantastic, though due to its wrap around nature terrifying if you drop your phone and I don't like cases
Size: I don't like big phones but this one is okay-ish
Feel: Just great and not cheap
Headphone Jack: No idea why it is on the bottom and I think it is awkward if you are using corded headphones to make calls because it changes the orientation, buttons on bottom.
Tray SD: Not a fan of this tray crap. Worried about getting it jammed and placing the card correctly. The old system was much better.
Bixy Button: Don't use it, no idea but it is annoying if you don't use it
Always On Display: Pretty nice but not necessary

B084H17M97,I love the pixel phone.,"Replacing a Samsung Note 3. Bought the Moto G6 as I needed asap in a $225 price range and it was returnable. Very nice extras.
Cons - No stylus. Didn't know how much I used the Stylus until I didn't have it. Was a bit of a data hog, had to do some restricting of apps. Case is very slick. Get a cover with it. It says textured, but it's very thin. So with a cover it's not huge. Enclosed battery so not replaceable.
Pros - Crazy long battery life! Super fast recharging! Has a Turbo Charge feature, whenever I am by the charger, I plug in. At 50% it takes about 20 minutes to charge to 100% But it can go all day long on and off 4G without a charge. If I was a road warrior, I could see having to charge this phone once a day. Also has the USB type C charger. Nice solid plug, not flimsy like the micro. You must use the factory cable, a 2.1A battery backup will provide Turbo Charge. But I never need to carry a spare battery! Excellent!
The Moto-motion is great! 2 chops and the flashlight turns on, again, turns off. 2 twists to left brings up camera, 2 twists for selfie, 2 twists for front again. Camera comes up fast for a photo. No fumbling in the dusk to find the camera function.
Phone has dual cameras - very nice pictures. I post to sell sites and this phone takes great photos.
Lots of memory (32GB) and I added a 32M card.
Phone is thin so adding a cover makes it a nice sized phone.
Bluetooth connects quickly, phone easily switches between wi-fi and 4G LTE flawlessly without my attention.
I'm sure there are more features I haven't discovered.

B07PBS21V8,Not as good as my old senso headphones,"I've used AirPods as my standard everyday listening headphones for the past 3-4 years, and for the most part I loved them. However, each pair of AirPods I've owned (AirPods Pro and AirPods 3rd Generation) only lasted 2-3 months before one of the buds would start having audio issues. The audio would be super low on one side, forcing me to adjust the equalization settings which in turn made the overall volume lower. This kept happening over and over and so recently I sort of just got fed up and decided to try something new.

It's unfortunate, because when the AirPods do work, they work great and are super convenient when paired with an iPhone. But the process of sending them back for repair every few months (even though it was free for me) became exhausting.

I picked up the LinkBuds after looking into alternatives to AirPods in a similar range of quality. i was also specifically interested in how the LinkBuds allow you to hear your surroundings much better than any other pair of earbuds. This may sound counterintuitive, since the whole point of using earbuds is to drown out the world, but for me it's been very useful in situations like when I'm at work and need to hear if someone is trying to talk to me, or when I'm outside walking around the block when I want to hear whether or not I'm about to be ran over by a car.

The one main issue people seem to complain about online a lot is the fit of the LinkBuds. Many people claim they just don't fit their ears well, but for me they actually fit perfect when using the largest pair of silicone tips (my ears must be big af because I needed the largest option on my AirPods Pros as well). For me, they feel more like they ""rest"" on the outside of my inner ear, rather than ""plugging"" your inner ear completely. This aids in both comortability and in hearing your surroundings.

I did take off one start mainly because of battery life and lack of wireless charging, which you'd definitely expect to see at this price point as I've seen even $50 pairs of earbuds that offer wireless charging. I also believe it shouldn't be quite as expensive for what it is... perhaps more like $130 or so would make more sense.

Overall though, i really like these earbuds and will likely be sticking with them until Apple comes out with a new model of AirPods, when of which I MIGHT consider trying those again.",3.0,"Reviewed

situations like when im at work and need to hear if someone is trying to talk to me or when im outside walking around the block when i want to hear whether or not im about to be ran over by a car the one main issue people seem to complain about online a lot is the fit of the linkbuds many people claim they just dont fit their ears well but for me they actually fit perfect when using the largest pair of silicone tips my ears must be big af because i needed the largest option on my airpods pros as well for me they feel more like they rest on the outside of my inner ear rather than plugging your inner ear completely this aids in both comortability and in hearing your surroundings i did take off one start mainly because of battery life and lack of wireless charging which youd definitely expect to see at this price point as ive seen even pairs of earbuds that offer wireless charging i also believe it shouldnt be quite as expensive for what it is perhaps more like or so would make more sense overall though i really like these earbuds and will likely be sticking with them until apple comes out with a new model of airpods when of which i might consider trying those

B07NWR7QYP,"Dual SIM works with AT&T, Fast delivery","This particular model works with Straight Talk when you buy a ""Bring your own phone sim kit"" from Straight Talk. Make sure your sim kit reflects your cell carrier that you wish to use (CDMA or GSM). Then call Straight Talk automated service and say your sim card number. That's it! Enjoy! The phone is amazing and I downloaded the latest Samsung and Android update which is 1/7/20. This phone can customize any app and with it's ""Notification App"" in Settings. Any app that you don't want (bloatware or elsewhere) can be turned off and hidden off of ANY screens! The ac modem and cpu are fast and the face recognition is perfect. I don't use the fingerprint feature. Whatever issues it had in the pass is corrected. The only time it doesn't work is in the dark of course, so just enter your secondary password / design / etc. This phone is so clear that I can hear the turn signals activating when speaking to someone driving. People tell me that I sound so different (clear) and I tell them about my new phone. It even has a night time mode that blackens the background and lights only the text so that it won't seem like a flashlight in your face. You can choose difference kelvin scale intensity lighting (cool to warm). It's ridiculous how much you can customize this phone. At the time of this review my phone is at 61% from 6:00 AM. It is now 10 PM and with wifi enabled. Please go to Samsung's website to better see it!

B0BYHB4DF5,10/10 Purchase,"Well, first let me preface my review on saying I don't use this as my main phone, I use this more as a storage partner to lighten the load on my main one. I still haven't put a sim card in it but it does damn near everything without one! I use my wifi and can do everything I do on my main phone faster and with a much bigger screen.

This phone came in excellent condition and it works amazing! It was worth every penny and then some! You're always a little skeptical when you buy anything used, let alone something that was formerly damaged, repaired, and then re-sold. But, as I said before, it was meant as my side-phone so as long as the storage I had heard about with this phone held true the cosmetics and things of that nature didn't matter. But the fact that it came looking like a brand new phone was truly icing on the cake. I initially was just going to get the Note 10, I had ordered it and everything and then in the process of looking into what memory card I was going to get along with some of the accessories people favored, I saw some people had said they hated that it didn't come with a memory slot. And I was like wait, what!!! I thought I had done my homework on it and missed that entirely and that was a deal breaker for me. Needless to say I canceled that one and ordered this 1 and I'm extremely glad I did.

I'm a check to make sure I put the right seller I bought from bcuz I wanna make sure they get the credit they deserve and hopefully I help bring them business. And here's to also hoping you guys get the same quality phone then I ended up with bcuz we all kno everybody's experiences are different. But I have no gripes with this phone at all. I'm even getting used to the power button on the left side of the phone. Lolz, its starting to make using my regular one feel kinda wierd. Smh.

But I ordered mine from Chubbiestech. I think I spelled that right. But shouts to them, amazing quality phone, that came fast, and theres honestly no bad things I could say about it. The phone it was replacing was a J7 Samsung Galaxy Prime, which is prehistoric now. Lol. And I was just gonna get another one of them bcuz it was just meant for storage and I was used to using it for that purpose for many a year, but 200 dollars for an old and used phone.... This was literally going from the stone ages to the Matrix in 0 to 60 seconds. But anyway, I hope this review helped sway at least a few people. It's a great buy for that price!

Oh, and I didn't rate the face recognition bcuz I still haven't used it. I'll come back if I ever decide to.

B01LXF0WML,Sony Xperia XZ is the best Smartphone ever,"*** First day Impressions***
Quick back story, I am a long time Nexus user, until my Nexus 5 decided to fail. I picked up the 1st gen Moto E as a hold over until I could figure out my future phone options. I operate on Cricket wireless prepaid as I do not like contracts and contract subsidized phones. The Moto E 1st gen was a serviceable phone with a fresh Kitkat v4.4.2 install. The major downside of the 1st gen E was its' abysmal storage (4 GB). After OS partition, you are left with mere MBs for precious apps, and not many apps can be loaded to the microSD. With the announcement of the 2nd gen 2015 Moto E, I was excited, as it features 4G LTE, slightly larger screen (4.5""), increased storage to 8 GB, a peppier Snapdragon 400 quad core chip, and Android Lollipop v 5.0.2.

After one day of use these are my impressions of the new and improved Moto E;

Hardware:
A lot more responsive than the 1st gen Moto E. The quad core and Lollipop feel quick with opening apps, switching between apps, and general usage. I do not game at all on my smartphones, so I can not comment on that. As for texting, music playback via Bluetooth, and navigation, these tasks are easily handled by the Snapdragon 400. After Lollipop partition, you are left with nearly 3 GB of usable storage. I supplemented my Moto E with a 32 GB microSD card for media and apps that can be stored on external memory.

-Battery life is excellent much like the 1st gen Moto E. With 4G LTE data, general use, web browsing, texting, Instagram, etc the battery easily lasts the full day.

-Display is not much to write home about. Its slightly larger than the 1st gen Moto E, but only by 0.2"" diagonally. A lot of reviewers will say the texts are blurred and that its tiny, but this is a testament to how spoiled we've become in the tech/smartphone sector. Coming from a larger Nexus 5 IPS 1080p screen, the 2nd gen Moto E is fine for me. Colors seem more vibrant in the Lollipop/material design compared to Kitkat v.4.4.2.

-Audio. The speaker quality seems much louder than the 1st gen Moto E. I do not have to max out my speaker volume if I'm using speakerphone or listening to a media clip. I found I had to adjust all my notification/alarm/media volumes to lower settings. Don't expect Dolby Digital theater quality here. Its a basic phone that fills the need for speaker volume.

-Camera. Very poor much like the 1st gen Moto E. You do get a 5 mp f/2.2 lens with focus (finally). Do not expect to get much of anything captured without sufficient ambient light, since the camera features no flash. The front facing VGA shooter is as bad as you'd expect. Quality is in line with 1st generation webcams. If you want a quick selfie for snapchat or something, it will suffice in well lit situations. Moto software allows very quick photo captures and ""tap anywhere"" on the screen to shoot.

Closing comments:
Motorola has done a great job packaging proper hardware and software into a budget off contract smartphone. The combination of 4G LTE and Android Lollipop v5.0.2 do make it feel relevant in the hyper competitive smartphone market. Motorola's own software tweaks on top of Android Lollipop offer great enhancements as well, though I'm still getting used to them. Motorola migrate worked well for transferring my old contacts/texts/media from my 1st gen Moto E. Moto display seems alright with displaying notifications without full waking the screen. The large software enhancements come in Lollipop, where Google has completely revamped the design aesthetics of its' OS. A large plus for me is the all day (and then some) battery life. Coming from larger and more powerful smartphones and always seeking a charger halfway through my day, I love having no fear actually utilizing the Moto E 2nd gen during work/errands/adventures.

I just received the phone few hours ago, so unable to give feed back based on the internal workability of the electronic product itself; I will update my review if needed.
Here are the things that is wrong with the product I was sent (pictures included):
1. There is somesort of weird piece of plastic sticking out from the edge of the phone screen. I tried to take it out (even with a tweezer) but it just wont come out. I can may be try to file the plastic but it has a high chance of getting the screen scratched.
2. WTH is wrong with the ear buds? OMG! The right side is only few inches long and the left one is regular length. How the heck am I supposed to use them. To use them I would have to lower down my neck to a 0° angle towards my right shoulder. Definitely not useable!
3. Are those ear buds for giants? They don't even fit and it hurts and are extremely uncomfortable because of the odd shape and size.

B07ZP9ZWFM,Exactly the phone that was ordered,"So, I liked my g7 power a lot, and this blows it out of the water. Photo quality, speed - all awesome. And about $50 cheaper than I can find anywhere. It works for gsm (I have T-Mobile/ MetroPCS). The unlocked phone gets activated a little differently than a locked phone. Totally worth it to bring it to a store to get it activated. I don't know how well calling in would have worked since I I didn't have a secondary phone to use, but I had some issues doing it by myself at home (could have been operator error as I'm not a tech person). Comes in box with a clear silicone case - which is awesome. But I'd already brought one, and I decided to use it.
The box and instructions were in Spanish, and the phone offers all instructions and updates in English and Spanish (same screen). I don't know if the latter is because this phone was designed for distribution in a Spanish speaking country, or a standard feature, but it's no big deal.

B09VCVGH7B,"Best TV, despite some bad reviews","After receiving my second Frame TV, due to the first being damaged in the shipping box, it was perfect for the bedroom. The TV I had on the wall prior to the Frame TV was always getting bumped as I walked by. Now I can walk freely between the Frame TV and the end of my bed.

The Setup on the Frame TV was so easy, a child could do it, and trust me, I'm not a child. I had it up and running within 10 minutes after placing it on the easy to install wall mounts. 1 1/5 inches from the wall beats 7"" and makes a big difference.

The quality of the picture makes me proud of my purchase. I now wish I had room on my living room to buy another Frame TV, but too many windows in the living room won't allow it.

In Stand-by mode, I use a USB drive to view all my pictures when I'm not watching TV or Sat or DVD's.

B0C3NV42GJ,Finally the perfect earbuds,"DO NOT BUY.

Only giving this three stars to hope this message reaches people more.

These were okay for the first few months. They fit okay and were not too bad while being active.

First, one earbud stopped working and only one would charge and then the other one went a few months later.

For the price I paid this is unacceptable. If you look at my history with headphones they are all Sennheiser and I've always recommended them but this is not acceptable.

Now I need to look for another brand to trust for quality headphones and that just sucks but I won't be supporting them after this.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024",C.

B09HN594TL,perfect!!!,"I looked all over the internet for wireless earbuds that are actually affordable (less than $30) and work well overall, and I found these! after having them for about a year, i can confidently say these are perfect (for me and maybe you)

(1) they have a small case meaning its easy to take anywhere
(2) the whole case and buds have magnets meaning nothing with pop out if you drop it from a short distance (they will if its at a higher distance but ultimately these are reliable)
(3) because they are wireless, small and black, im able to wear these in class under my hair without my teacher knowing
(4) the charging cable is great as i can charge it anywhere without needing an extra cable
(5) the price is great for the quality
(6) these are super easy to use (with the taps and stuff found in the manual given)
(7) the battery life is amazing (takes less than 2 hours to fully charge the case and it lasts me like 5 days)
(8) its practical (i can use the buds separately to extend the battery life and they rarely fall from my ear)
(9) it does have some noise cancellation and the sound doesn't escape (just make sure not to blast it)
(10) you can easily connect it to multiple devices

also cause im lowkey a clumsy person, ive dropped these like 30 times so i ended up killing the left bud, but the right one still worked (how?)

B0B7MYFM3Q,FW5-Black with an OLD Phone. Be Aware of Poor-Quality Control,"Noise cancellation is perfect, quality of sound it's decent. Price/quality absolutely great.

it has a rich bass and clear separation of musical instruments make for an enjoyable listening experience. However, the build quality feels less premium compared to higher-priced models, and the ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) feature, while adequate for reducing background hums, falls short in canceling more intrusive noises like conversations.

A standout feature is the comfort of these earbuds, which come with five different sizes of eartips to ensure a secure fit for all-day wear without discomfort. The 32-hour battery life, including the charging case, and the fast charging capability are highly convenient, ensuring your music is always on. Additionally, the Donner Control App allows for extensive customization of the EQ settings and other features, enhancing the user experience.

Despite the high-quality sound and comfortable fit, the earbuds emit a loud 'bong' when not connected to a device, which can be jarring. Also, the transparency mode doesn't perform as expected, adding a layer of white noise rather than clearly transmitting surrounding sounds. Nevertheless, for $49.99, these earbuds offer great value, providing features and performance that compete with more expensive alternatives.

B079Z9P4LD,2018 Blu xl3 is dope,"Context:
- I have been looking for a phone with a physical keyboard for when I need to type a lot on the go.
- I have owned many blackberries in the past. At least 5 of them over the years.
- I do not care about the lack of apps on this platform so that is not even a consideration.

Summary:
- I liked that blackberry took a risk in coming out with this phone but several reasons led me to return it.
- Many people have already written about what makes this phone great, so I will focus mostly on why it didn't work for me.
- While the phone didn't work for me for the reasons below, I am rating it a 4 because it is overall a good device and I can see for the right person that this phone could be great. I also think it's important to recognize and reward BB for their risk taking in innovating with a new form factor.

Reasons:
- While the largish screen is nice, the 1:1 aspect ratio is quite a limitation when trying to read pdfs. Specifically, with a phone with a normal aspect ratio, it is possible to rotate the phone into landscape mode so that you can read the entire width of a letter sized document at reasonable text size. Not so with the Passport. This means that the only way to read pdfs with even normal text at a comfortable size is to zoom in and the scroll left and right as you read down the page. This is extremely tedious as you can imagine.
- I discovered that the missing third row of keys was an issue for me. I thought I would be able to adapt quickly and I actually enjoyed having softkeys for some things. I didn't even mind the difference in feel between the softkeys on screen and the physical keys. However, missing the third row and requiring softkeys for numbers made typing much slower than I had hoped. I wonder why they didn't include the alt-key combo functionality?
- It's tiring to type on this keyboard for any period of time. I don't ever remember having issues like this with blackberries before. I don't know if it's the weight of the phone or the balance of the device or the feel of the keys. Or perhaps it's just because I've become used to and good at typing softkeys on glass. No matter the reason, the keyboard was not comfortable to use over time.
- The device is not comfortable to *hold* in one hand. I did not expect to be able to *use* it one-handed, but expected that it would be manageable to hold it one handed when I was reading something. Not so. The sharp angles on the phone, which I think make the phone look nice, made it uncomfortable to hold. I suspect this is why the AT&T version has rounded corners.
- Overall, having used and tried to like this device for a week (I even bought a screen protector and back case for it), I was surprised to discover that I could still type much faster and more comfortably on glass.

While I have been a blackberry fan, I wonder if softkeys and improvements in auto-correct have made it so that people can now type faster on glass than on physical keys. Specifically, I thought I was looking for a phone with physical keys but maybe that's not needed any more and in fact is slower. Is it possible that the market and consumers have moved on and physical keys are not really needed even for people who thought they needed it?

p.s.

B0BV7HBJLJ,Old school cell flip phone.,"I've been a fan of the Samsung Galaxy series forever. I usually purchase brand new, FACTORY unlocked. Seldom do I purchase a phone from any carrier. Primarily because of the control the carrier has over the phone that you are able to purchase. Bloat ware, carrier branding, and even control over the cellular band/chips that are included. Just because it is labeled a ""Samsung S20+"" doesn't mean that it is the exact same phone sold by every carrier. And unfortunately, even knowing all this I was somewhat deceived by this listing. Let me be clear- THIS IS NOT A TRUE FACTORY UNLOCKED PHONE. This is a CARRIER UNLOCKED phone. I should of known this by doing a quick of the model number. If the samsung phone ends in U1 - it is a carrier phone. True factory unlocked phones end in U.
But that oversight was my fault, as the model number was clearly listed. But as a reseller, they know this.. and the title is somewhat misleading. I should of known.
So the bloatware, and Verizon branding screens will live until I'm able to flash the internal microchip.

The other thing that I found particularly irritating, was the included charger. I understand that accessories might not be original Samsung equipment. (was noted in the listing) But it goes on to say ""but will be compatible and fully functional."" The charger that was included was indeed a brand new charger.. but it was a simple 1AMP charger. No where NEAR a true Samsung QC3.0 (Qualcom 3.0) charger. Sure, if you shop around on Amazon you can find a good deal, so its not that horrible expensive to replace. But for a company that probably sells hundreds or thousands of these (not truly) ""factory unlocked"" phones, they could negotiate a cheaper price per charger-- then what your typical amazon shopper can find online. And that is just really pathetic, and cheap.

(For those who want fully functional charger. be sure to search for QC3.0 charger. Qualcom holds a patent on internals, and is not the same as a ""fast charger"". There is often confusion because when you plug in your samsung it says: fast charging. A samsung phone will not fast charge unless it is a Qualcom/QC charger)

But hey, its not all bad! I know i'm being extremely hard on the seller GreenTech. But this is primarily because they most likely know all of the things I've written. And to perpetuate the already deceiving and confusing US cell phone market created by Verizon/ATT is in-excusable. Greentech is selling refurbished phones, and the least is be completely upfront and come clean about everything from the carrier modified phones to the included cheap 1amp chargers.

And after all my ranting, what is good? The condition. I purchased an acceptable rated phone. They were completely true to the rating description. The screen had several shallow scratches that were totally invisible when the screen is on. And the back side had some minor scratching as well, but the camera lens was completely fine, and was really just cosmetic. The delivery was also prompt. I also felt that the price was good, too.

But they will have to work harder to get 5 stars from me. For me it was what I would expect as average, 3 stars. I hope Greentech reads my review and strives for something above just average.

The phone.. well I think i summed that up in the beginning. Samsung makes awesome phones, and this S20+ is no different. I love it. and that is what makes a company like Greentech refurbished possible. Exceptional phones, made by a company that far above average.

B08DNZ6ZPF,"Feel great, don't work so well","First off using the bose connect - user manual - the search does not work. Totally lame. Tried the word ""charge"" because there are several entries - nothing. Absolutely not acceptable from a major corporation. Bluetooth hook up no problem.

Slide switches in the app are blacked out - cannot determine if these are on or off. In fact the entire app is black and white. Really? why?

Looking for an equalizer now. Surely there must be some means to adjust the bass, treble, etc. Come on! How do you make profile? Google search explains that another app should be downloaded - ""Bose Music"". No mention anywhere in the accompanying docs. ***Mistake - the Bose Music app is not for these headphones and there is no equalizer anywhere. After searching further the dev team are considering adding it to the Bose Connect app. WOW! I cannot state this with any larger font WOW!!.

Yes the sound is very good. I won't bother with small things like not USB-C. They do feel like they won't fall out ever - which was a concern moving over from a wired bluetooth set (that had an equalizer in the app). (Bose Music app needed too). **** don't bother - the app is not for this product. Here is the Bose response found on their community ""Regarding EQ settings, this is not currently available on the Bose Connect App to manually change. However, I would like to remind you that the SoundSport Free has volume-optimized EQ & Bose digital signal processing to make music sound full & balanced at any volume.""

Regarding the Bose Connect app. The version downloaded was 2.6.0. In the app there is an update to 2.8.0. The app claims to be prepping to update - but it isn't. It's doing nothing. Sheesh!

Summation: Of course good sound as one would expect from Bose. I am sure I will like them. But a score for out of the box experience is at best a 2 out of 10. Whenever one needs to search the internet for answers on a new product there will avenues and alleys that you travel down that don't pay off. It adds frustration - adding an app not needed is a big one for me - particularly when the wrong app is as poor in direction as can be.

BTW I started with a 4 out of 10. It dropped to a 2 out of 10 for ""out of box experience"". Again the sound is great as it should be for Bose and for the price.

Thank you.

B07YMHGW9X,"Died after 5 months, dialed 911.","it's much faster / nearly double than my previous G4; many improvements.
new motions/swiping: could've kept same & added more; it's odd going between phones.
sometimes swipes don't register and occasional lag, but that could likely be cross-app interference (?)
over all: GREAT step up from my G4, comfortable & generally content w/ it.
improvements: screen could be brighter; log-on: automatically adjust to current light conditions; if you dimmed it the night before & go to sign on in sunlight, it can be near invisible to see the keypad to enter your code.
Settings button should be in the top screen pulldown (icon is rather small & not one of the 'main' icon options, but off to the side, small, on its own)
taking out voice record option on core software ;not cool if you choose to record phone conversations-that option is gone; replacement app options inadequate now.

B00D99DHH2,Four Stars,"Great phone! Quite possible it is the fastest phone in the world. With the latest Snapdragon 835 and only a 4.6 inch 720p screen, it's a beast. I've owned multiple Sony compact phones but this outshines them all.
What I like- the volume is louder than all other Sony phones. It gets stronger signal for wifi and cell service. The camera takes better pictures of moving subjects than any other phone I've used. I try a lot at stores too. The screen is extremely bright! Great for outdoors. Charges fast up to 70%. Utilizing the Q3 technology. Battery life is AMAZING. I easily get 6-8 hours of screen time before it hits 15%. It gets t-mobile volte and wifi calling!
Dislikes-no fingerprint without flashing firmware. Google smartlock is great to save time without a fingerprint though. The camera...while video is great, and camera is lacking. Post processing artifacts (when you zoom in on photos) is worse than ever! Older high megapixel phones perform better. Even the previous x compact, and regular x/x performance. Most people won't mind it. I barely mind it. Small sacrifice for everything else the camera can do. Maybe a software update with a less aggressive camera algorithm will solve it. Double tap to wake is gone. I downloaded an app to wake a screen by proximity sensor to substitute.
Summary - is this a great phone? Yes. Flagship quality in a small form factor for Android fans. Overall it's a 9/10. It's easily worth $450-$500. I'd buy two of these before one new iPhone, galaxy, or pixel.
Complaint about what's new ads :: Just download an app that hides app notifications. I did for a few apps that gave running in background or screen overlay notifications.

B07CL4GLQW,Good quality in a smaller TV,"I wanted a TV to wall-mount in my bedroom where I have limited space. I was a little surprised to learn that it's actually getting difficult to find a top-quality TV in a smaller size these days - this Samsung was about the best we could find in a 32"" model. Still, despite it's small size, it does have all the essential features, as well as a very good picture quality.

The TV itself is very light weight and was easy to wall mount. I used an articulating arm mount that lets me tilt and position the TV any way I want, and the light weight helped make this easy. The TV remote is the same as other recent Samsung TV's use, so if you're used to the layout, it will seem very comfortable to you.

This is a ""smart"" TV, meaning that it has apps for things like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and many others available. With a fast internet connection, you should have no trouble watching whatever you like through the TV, even if you're a cord-cutter. It's probably a small thing to most people, but I also appreciate that the power draw - especially when the TV is off - is very low.

I'd rate the picture quality as very good overall, with a nice bright picture that's sharp and contrasty with most content. Black levels are good, and about the only thing I notice is a certain ""harshness"" that's common to lots of TV's these days. I admit, I was a plasma holdout, and now my main TV is a 75"" OLED just to avoid this issue, so I may be a little more sensitive than most.

Overall, if you need a good quality smaller Smart TV that's still capable of putting a nice quality image in front of you, then this Samsung is definitely worth a try.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2018",Susan Maldonado,Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CL4GLQW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_8?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8,"SAMSUNG 32-inch Class LED Smart FHD TV 1080P (UN32N5300AFXZA, 2018 Model), Black",Visit the SAMSUNG Store,4.2 out of 5 stars,"About this itemFull HD 1080p Resolution - Enjoy a viewing experience that is 2x the clarity of standard HD TVs..Power Supply (V) AC110-120V 50/60Hz.Image Aspect ratio:16:9.Picture Processor : HyperReal, Audio - Dolby : Yes, Sound Output (RMS) : 10W(L:5W, R:5W)..Screen Type : Flat Panel.

B08KRKFHGV,My second Now 10 Plus. Best phone I've ever owned..,"I gave this 3 stats because of the software. I felt like google could've done a better job especially since this is a pure android device. The notification system is stupid.

When someone text me and I respond to it from the notification window the text remains there in the notifications. If I'm the last person to respond why do I need to see my own .message in the notifications?? That's stupid! If I respond the notification needs to go away!

If get a bunch of notifications (emails, text) and I swipe them away, more notifications show up IMMEDIATELY. Sometimes they aren't even new. I literally have to press ""clear all"" 3x for the notifications to go away.

I also don't like that if I'm on a website that I'm trying to upload a image to, the phone sends you on a wild goose chase to find your ""gallery"". By default it brings up ""recent images"" and I think that's dumb. You should be able to choose what it defaults to. Even still when you press on ""camera"" it'll still take you to another screen that you have to press ""camera"" again just to get to the images you took with your camera.

These things can be fixed with software but it's super annoying, especiy the notifications. Not to mention I bought a fossil smart watch that runs wear OS and if I check a email from last year, the watch will send me a notification from that email like I just received it! STUPID!

B079Z792J7,Great Phone Nice Features,"I was all set to pony up $700 for the new Oneplus 7 Pro when Google formally announced the Pixel 3a and it showed up on Amazon along with a promotion that included $100 gift card. That was too good to pass up. There are tons of reviews and videos on both phones, so I won't add much here, except to comment on the two things that I had qualms about before ordering: 1) The phone feels very solid despite the plastic body. The build quality far surpasses my old plastic Nexus 5x. 2) The phone is plenty fast despite having a processor that is on paper inferior to the ones in the Oneplus 7 Pro and other expensive phones.

B00WJE3B38,Forces Muslim Calendar on you!,"I've been very impressed with this phone, and I've gone through my fair share of mobile devices over the years. I put all my devices through their paces, modifying and customizing almost everything. My new HTC Desire 816 has held up wonderfully--so well, actually, that I've stuck with much of the out-of-the-box functions. Here are some things that have really impressed me with this phone:

- Battery life has exceeded my expectations. I came from a Galaxy S4, which began to overheat and chew through its battery, so I was pleasantly surprised when I could get about 36 hours of battery life from my new HTC. The sad reality with new devices is that, with more powerful processors being smooshed between thinner and thinner devices, battery life inevitably suffers. The 816's specs are just a notch below the One M8's, and luckily, this is a plus for battery life. At the end of the day, as apps get increasingly innovative, they suck more life from your battery. It just happens.

- Screen size. It's huge. A 5.5"" screen is the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus, for reference. The immense screen is borderline unwieldy--holding the phone in one hand, it's difficult to reach the topmost corner with your thumb. It takes some getting used to, but in the end, I really appreciate the increased screen real estate. Although they never mention it, this phone falls under the ""phablet"" category.

- The Boom Sound speakers are the bread and butter of the HTC line. I can't tell you how nice it is not to have to cup my hand around a rear speaker! Why didn't anyone think of this before? The overall sound quality is fantastic as well. I'm not into listening to music without headphones, but watching videos and movies is immensely more enjoyable with front-facing speakers. Bravo, HTC.

I could go on, but suffice it to say that I'm very fond of this phone. Paying under $200 for a phone is a miracle notwithstanding, but when it's a solid device like the Desire 816, I'm happy.",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2014",CWLJOE,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00WJE3B38/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_6?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6,,,,,Mobile,ive been very impressed with this phone and ive gone through my fair share of mobile devices over the years i put all my devices through their paces modifying and customizing almost everything my new htc desire has held up wonderfullyso well actually that ive stuck with much of the outofthebox functions here are some things that have really impressed me with this phone battery life has exceeded my expectations i came from a galaxy s which began to overheat and chew through its battery so i was pleasantly surprised when i could get about hours of battery life from my new htc the sad reality with new devices is that with more powerful processors being smooshed between thinner and thinner devices battery life inevitably suffers the s specs are just a notch below the one ms and luckily this is a plus for battery life at the end of the day as apps get increasingly innovative they suck more life from your battery it just happens screen size its huge a screen is the same size as the iphone plus for reference the immense screen is borderline unwieldyholding the phone in one hand its difficult to reach the topmost corner with your thumb it takes some getting used to but in the end i really appreciate the increased screen real estate although they never mention it this phone falls under the phablet category the boom sound speakers are the bread and butter of the htc line i cant tell you how nice it is not to have to cup my hand around a rear speaker why didnt anyone think of this before the overall sound quality is fantastic as well im not into listening to music without headphones but watching videos and movies is immensely more enjoyable with frontfacing speakers bravo htc i could go on but suffice it to say that im very fond of this phone paying under for a phone is a miracle notwithstanding but when its a solid device like the desire im happy,ive been very impressed with this phone and ive gone through my fair share of mobile devices over the years i put all my devices through their paces modifying and customizing almost everything my new htc desire has held up wonderfullyso well actually that ive stuck with much of the outofthebox functions here are some things that have really impressed me with this phone battery life has exceeded my expectations i came from a galaxy s which began to overheat and chew through its battery so i was pleasantly surprised when i could get about hours of battery life from my new htc the sad reality with new devices is that with more powerful processors being smooshed between thinner and thinner devices battery life inevitably suffers the s specs are just a notch below the one ms and luckily this is a plus for battery life at the end of the day as apps get increasingly innovative they suck more life from your battery it just happens screen size its huge a screen is the same size as the iphone plus for reference the immense screen is borderline unwieldyholding the phone in one hand its difficult to reach the topmost corner with your thumb it takes some getting used to but in the end i really appreciate the increased screen real estate although they never mention it this phone falls under the phablet category the boom sound speakers are the bread and butter of the htc line i cant tell you how nice it is not to have to cup my hand around a rear speaker why didnt anyone think of this before the overall sound quality is fantastic as well im not into listening to music without headphones but watching videos and movies is immensely more enjoyable with frontfacing speakers bravo htc i could go on but suffice it to say that im very fond of this phone paying under for a phone is a miracle notwithstanding but when its a solid device like the desire im happy,1,Positive,2,1

B0BZ8X9HGT,Very good,"I recently purchased the Microsoft Surface Laptop (2024), and overall, I’m incredibly impressed with its performance. The 13.8"" touchscreen display is vibrant and crisp, and the Snapdragon X Elite (12-core) processor makes multitasking a breeze. With 16GB of RAM and 1TB SSD storage, this laptop handles everything I throw at it—whether it’s video editing, running complex software, or just casual browsing. Windows 11 runs smoothly, and the device feels premium and well-built. Battery life is outstanding, and it’s surprisingly lightweight, making it great for both work and travel. The laptop is fast, responsive, and does exactly what I need without any hiccups. However, my one gripe is that after spending nearly $2,000 on this high-end machine, I still have to pay extra for Copilot+. Given the price of the laptop, I would have expected this feature to be included, especially since it’s one of Windows 11's flagship features. While Copilot+ is a helpful AI tool, it feels like it should be a standard part of the package. Overall, I’m still giving it 5 stars because the hardware is fantastic, and it excels at everything I use it for.

B07536MYBQ,"NOT ""factory Unlocked","The phone arrived several days early, shipped to me by seller ""Mobile Dist"".

The phone looks, literally, brand new. I cannot find a scratch, scuff or dent on it. It came with an original OnePlus box, but there was no OnePlus charger, or replacement charger provided. No charger at all. That's the caveat to my 5-star review: I don't really care about the missing charger (I've got plenty) but I know some people will.

Things I was worried about before ordering the phone:

Battery life - battery life has been fine, and the phone has no trouble lasting through the day.

Fingerprint scanner - I have tried in-display fingerprint sensors in the past, and always been disappointed. Even the best ones made me wish for a capacitive scanner instead. The scanner on this phone, though, is good enough that I do not find myself constantly wishing for a capacitive scanner. It is not quite as reliable as the capacitive scanner on my last phone (a Pixel) but the failures are infrequent enough that it doesn't really bother me. In a week of using the phone, I think there've only been two times when the sensor just would not read my fingerprint and I was forced to use my PIN code to unlock the phone.

Curved glass edges - I don't know why these are a thing, and I wish this phone had a flat display - but I knew what I was buying going in. I've had fewer false touches than I expected, though, so maybe less of a concern than I expected. I am still looking for a case that will provide a little more coverage of the edges though.

Other random observations:

B0BVXG2G5N,The buffering time is ridiculous,Sound quaility wasn't important for me because of the Denon receiver that this tv connects to does the sound. I like the remote which has nice pointer feature that is very responsive and accurate like a laser pointer. The tv has many ways of fine tuning the picture. I had to search youtube to access the signal level for broadcast channels but it is there if you look for it. This LG UR9000 tv is not edge lit which I like allot. The black level is very good and also the screen can get very bright if you want the screen bright. With an internet connection the tv offers many hundreds of free channels.

B085S3CPNK,Spend the extra to get a better phone!,"I'm used to my phone dying on me and being on a charger multiple times a day. So the fact that this phone can go 24+ hours without completely dying is like sorcery to me. I took it on a 6 hour road trip and let the screen on with the map the entire time, never depleted any battery. Forgot to take the charger out of my car and still had about 60% the next morning. Charged it on the car while using maps again and was able to fully charge it during my drive. The battery life on this is phenomenal.

The camera is can either be really amazing or just ok. I'm sure if I put it in professional mode more often I'd get the pics I want, but I'm not complaining too much.

The speaker quality is ok as long as you don't turn the volume up all the way. It reminds me of the older phones when people try to play music on their crappy speaker. Listening to audio books or pod casts isn't too bad, but not digging the music playing. Haven't had any issues with hearing people or people hearing me, as of yet and it's been almost a month now.

The ads on the lock screen don't bother me at all and I already had most of the Amazon apps installed ony previous devices so the preinstalls didn't bother me either, especially for the decent discount you get.

B09LPK77YY,Definitely worth the purchase!,"I had an unlocked STA100-5 phone with OS 10.2 for about 6 months ( I've used iPhone and WP7 before it). I've used it on the T-mobile network in US.

Great:
- LTE works on T-mobile! Yay!
- Amazing touch keyboard. No, I mean AMAZING. Like it reads your mind. I speak two languages and a frequently text/email friends where I'm using a mixture of both. I couldn't believe it. Nothing comes close to it.
- Premium build, solid construction. Feels great in hand.
- Battery life: for such a large screen getting almost 2 days of battery life with moderate use is a feat worth mentioning it. LOVE IT!
- Centralized HUB for all the messages, events, etc

Good:
- Alert customizations, LED flashing
- Good app store. Not the same selection as Apple's App store or even Microsoft's but I was surprised to see the diversity and the quality of the apps. I saw developers porting success games onto BB and tried to encourage them by purchasing a bunch of apps and games. BB is a great platform to develop for (I think).

Not so good:
- button placements: I couldn't get used to the power button being on the top and in the middle. Hard to reach even with my long fingers (phone is not small either). The volume buttons on the right are too low (also hard to reach while talking on the phone).
- Screen turns off during the talk and have to press the power button to come back on. With other phones you simply move it away from your year and the screen turns on. Combine this with the power button placement issue described above and it gets even more irritating.
- Can't get out of the camera app by swiping up (like you can from other apps). I had to press the power button twice to turn the screen off and on again for that to work. Very annoying as well. In general, the camera app was pretty bad. I was avoiding it. I hope they improved it in the new 10.3.
- Call waiting stopped working after a while. (?!)
- Wired headset with mic doesn't work very well with Z30 (the same headset works great with iPhone, WP phone, etc). It feeds the sound from your local mic into the headphones so it sounds noisier than in the other setups.
- Camera doesn't take very good pictures in low light or with moving subjects. It is quite good with good light and static subjects though.
- Filesystem is confusing. There are multiple links pointing to the same location in the filesystem. Hard to figure out where to place your custom ring tones for example.

Worst:
- Blackberry Link doesn't work at all on a Mac. Seriously Blackberry? I'm a software engineer and couldn't get the damn think to work even after spending 10+ hours. Multiple re-installs did not fix it. Looks like the Mac version was written by an intern :-)
- Because of the above I could not transfer pictures in/out or music easily to/from my phone. I gave up on the BB Link and purchased a memory card. This works around the broken BB Link because you can remove the card from the phone and plug it in your computer to transfer the files.
- Default ring tones and alert sounds are really bad. It took my a day of work to be able to customize them (partly because of the broken BB Link). I ended up using Bluetooth to transfer the sounds to the phone!

I ended up selling my Z30 and going back to WP7 (HTC M9). Cortana (WP 7 personal assistant) is better than the digital assistant on BB (at least on 10.2, they say that it was improved on 10.3) and M6's camera is massively better than the Z30. However, I miss the awesome virtual keyboard and the gestures on Z30. I was hoping BB will release an updated Z30, but the BB Leap is a ""downgrade"": No HDMI, no NFC, lower battery life, etc. Most of the complaints above can be resolved with a software upgrade with the exception of the buttons placement.

B01NA00WW3,Definitely Worth The Buy,"I purchased the TCL 55S405 because it was the cheapest 55"" set with HDR (HDR10) that I could find at the time and while I was tempted by the P-series model (55P607) I did not need the fancier remote (nice to have but the Roku app can do what it can do), Dolby HDR (there's barely any HDR content out there at all as-is and most of it worth watching is priced at a heavy premium), or local dimming (nice, but not worth the $200 price premium for me). I have generally been very pleased with it and the picture is excellent. 4k/HDR content that I tested through YouTube looks great, although at this point in time the amount of 4k content and especially HDR content out there is limited. Hopefully both will see more mainstream adoption and more content will become available in time. The only real letdowns I have had with my TCL 55S405 are that mine shipped with a single dead pixel (not worth the hassle of a return or warranty claim, especially since it is unnoticeable with normal viewing and only really visible within about 3 feet of the TV) and that the built-in YouTube app is much glitchier than the one I'm used to on my Roku Premiere (it skips the first second of audio on every video, the app crashes the TV once in a while, and audio skips badly on certain music-only videos), although it works pretty well 95% of the time. Otherwise, the built in Roku platform is amazing and leaps and bounds better than any other smart OS out there and performs flawlessly. If you're buying a smart TV for the built-in smart features, this is the cream of the crop.

Sound is just okay. For a small room like the one I'm using it in, I see no need to buy a sound bar/sound system. Those who love audio will definitely want to invest some money there, though. It's not really a fault of the TV as it's a problem for most modern TVs so I am not factoring that into my rating. For gaming, the set performs well but I'll stick to my gaming monitor. Motion blur is tolerable but present and input lag is very low (at least for a TV). If you do not want to invest in a gaming monitor, it's more than adequate for gaming. While this set is advertised as having ""120Hz CMI,"" it's a 60hz panel and I do not notice any improvement in motion over the other 60hz sets I own. Motion blur is perfectly tolerable. I see no soap opera effect. The viewing angle of the set is so-so and you will definitely want to sit as close to the center as possible.

Note that this set does NOT ship with an enhanced remote. It has a standard IR remote (it must be pointed at the set to work) and no headphone jack for private listening.

B07K5HMW15,"When will you get it right, Google?","Had to contact seller because the phone language was set to Chinese, and no way to set it up because I dont understand that language. Seller did call back and left a message and told me I would have to do a “hard reset” and to just go online for instructions. I think perhaps the seller should be responsible for including that info with the phone, since not all of us are knowledgeable about new technology.
I got that part figured out, thankfully, but just 2 weeks later the phone started messing up. About half the time when I try to open phone, it just blinks like the screen is going out and goes black. Some times I can get it to work after several tries, but other times I have to remove the battery and then put it back in to get it to start. Neither option is convenient when you need to use your phone quickly. I left 3 messages with the seller, because every time I call, it just goes straight to voicemail, and have yet to receive a reply. Would be nice if they would have been willing to replace the phone, but it’s now it’s past 30 days, so I am stuck with a phone that works about half the time, and out a little over $150.
