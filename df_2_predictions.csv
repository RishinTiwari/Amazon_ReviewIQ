this is a low cost large screen phone so its going to have some compromises but there are some areas that arent good and its inexcusable software updates this phone has gotten one software update since i got it and now has an april security patch level the april instead of april means blu only applied some security patches to this phone and not all of them i have very little hope that this phone will ever get any more security updates which is a very bad thing android is a complex operating system and google releases monthly patches for a reason after the update that brought it up to april i did not notice any actual changes at all other than the date changing on the patch level status all of my issues i found before the update were still present overall security there are some major problems with security on this phone the fingerprint reader gives you unlimited tries to unlock the phone this is very insecure and someone could easily try to bruteforce the reader there are no timeouts no lockouts no nothing just unlimited repeated tries not only that you can use your fingerprint to unlock the phone after a reboot it does not require your password this is also very bad and i have never seen another phone do this beter phones require you to enter your password on first boot or if you havent used your fingerprint reader in a few days i turned on require password at startup to try to mitigate this it essentially wont boot android until you type in your password it was hard to get this setting to stay turned on but it seems to work now android auto is broken the phone will look like its about to work with an android auto head unit but it will just reboot right before it shows the screen on your car stereo it will do this indefinitely streaming bluetooth works fine but just hope to use it with an android auto head unit this didnt change after the recent update auto brightness is so broken the phone has some power saving feature for the screen which alters the display backlight level based on content the phone will dim the backlight when the overall screen is bright this is called economical backlight in the settings i find this rather annoying as the backlight is constantly changing based on whats on the screen so like you pull down the notifications which are mostly white the screen dims then slide it back up and it brightens there is a lag time to this effect so you can see this happening while you can untick the option to disable it if you keep adaptive brightness turned on then turning off economical backlight does not actually disable the tickbox is actually unchecked but you can clearly tell its not disabled only if you also turn off adaptive brightness so the phone will ignore the ambient light sensor will this economical mode be disabled this doesnt break your usage of the phone but its just really annoying on top of that the adaptive brightness feature is just very broken it responds somewhat to the environment but it always seems to be too bright or too dim you turn it up so its bright enough during the day but then at night its really too bright this feels like im using an android phone where adaptive brightness was a lot more problematic boring android skin with bad english translations for some reason they didnt just stick with stock android and applied a blu skin to the os it has many areas where the english is badly translated and it a bit hard to understand the skin makes android feel clunky and strange but overall it does work i guess there is no adjustment for screen dpi but you can change it with adb look at xda for help on this but why did they hide this settings otherwise the phone seems fine for a phone the screen is bright enough but has bad color gamut even for a lcd the loudspeaker is pretty bad sounding battery life is decent the phone isnt very fast its entirely made of plastic it still uses microusb versus usb typec i can honestly understand all of this as it is a very inexpensive phone its just the lack of attention on the software side that is very disappointing the lowend motorola phones do not have these issues and you may better served there,0,0,0
this is a great phone with many features well worth stars however after spending a month with off and on contact with customer service i am very dissatisfied the day after i got my phone there was a tiny tiny hairline crack i didnt worry about it because it could only be seen if you looked for it well a couple months later the mic stops working and only works on speakera common issue with these phones after a quick google search i emailed back and forth for a week with slow responses for troubleshooting with no prevail after a week i called them they said its covered under warranty and would be fixed at no charge i sent them my phone then about a week and a half later i get an email saying they cant fix the mic because the hairline crack in the screen a completely unrelated issue for the repair i reply via the contact link in the email days later no reply so i do it again days pass with no reply so i call them again they say they cant fix just the mic related issue i say why not and they say just becauserudely and unprofessional i talk to a manager again same thing just saying they cant fix just one issue i ask why and he says because very upset i asked for the phone to be sent back they give me my tracking number later that night i go on fedex and see it will be here on a thursday before my trip i didnt look at it again until thurs rolls around and i dont have my phone i look online and its still at the repair facility i call htc again everything is normal was said about times from the agent i said can you check he finally goes to check and apparently they didnt even move it to the shipping center they just left it sitting on a shelf for a week overall horrible service they cant fix their own phone related problems under warranty they are very unorganized and unprofessional lucky amazon is awesome and refunded me my money which i will use to buy a phone that i can actually use as a phone,0,0,0

update my new techno bravo b headset arrived on i love the blue color within a few days the silicon ear bud fell off and we had to search the house this is the worst feature of this amazing bluetooth headset ive only owned this headset for months and the ear bud falls off at least times a week almost every day the best feature of the techno bravo b is the long battery life i adore it but suddenly now it wont recharge when i plug it into the charger sometimes a faint red light will come on but then it blinks off right away in a normal charging routine when you plug in the charger a solid red light shows and turns into a solid blue light when the charge is completed for the past week it will not recharge and ive tried different chargers in different wall outlets so sadly i believe it is dead it is past the day warranty date so i will probably buy a different brand of bluetooth headset with long playing time even though i have been a solid techno bravo fan for years update ive owned these amazing techno b bluetooth headsets for yr months with constant daily usage of easily hours a day or more they just died this week and im pretty sad we were best friendsnow im back to my apple airpods that last about hours before needing a recharge i took out an airpod so it wouldnt fall out of my ear and didnt put it back in the case i panicked for a little bit but knew that it was still inside my house thankfully i found it in a pocket i never had to worry about losing the techno bluetooth headset i loved that feature and i liked the neck curve in the cord the biggest complaint that i had for the years that i owned this headset is that pretty much every day the silicone earbud andor earhook would fall off so frustrating and such a pain my family was always helping me find my lost earbuds that we called my blueberries because they look exactly like a blueberry the earhooks were easier to find because of the size and the hook i always found the lost hooks im torn weather to buy this brand again i love everything else about them the newer model from this techno brand does not have the ear hook only the earbud but for my ear shape the earhooks really help keep the earbuds in and not fall off apple airpods fall out of me ears all the time i know that you can buy earhooks for airpods but then you have to remove the earhooks before putting the airpods back in their charging case and then where do you put the earhooks or you can buy a tether for your airpods but then where do you put your tether when the airpods are charging in their case thats why i am a techo fan pretty much love the design and functionality of this bluetooth except for looking for the earbudsblueberries that fall off every day original review that i forgot to submit after i first bought them and used them for a while im a bluetooth headset junkie and have tried so many brands but i love these tecno headsets they have never run out of power and ill wear them for hours listening to audible books spotify youtube podcasts the news all of my other bluetooth headsets will have run out of power by then but these still have power i love the leash style because i can leave one hanging which lets me hear whats going on around me with airpods if i take one out i have to find the case so i wont lose it and now i have a case to carry the leash has weights on the left and right lengths so that the earbuds dont flap around or fly away the leash also has a preformed curve for your neck a great feature i think the only bad thing are the silicone ear hooks and ear buds they fall off all the time especially the hooks they give you extras but they are different sizes which is why i took off star with a replacement ear bud they dont fit as tight so they are not noise cancelling still these are my favorite bluetooth headsets,0,1,0
worst purchase the phones broke in little to no time waste of money im fact i dont think this phone was new as they marketed it,0,0,0
purchased as an offcontract replacement for a damaged phone knew we were sacrificing some recent advancements for a more affordable outofpocket price having had good luck with motorola phones previously the droid bionic has been a disappointment phone calls a primary objective of a cell phone after all are barely audible have had to resort to taking most calls on speakerphone has a tremendous lag most every app runs in fits and starts texting for example will freeze in process and then release input in a burst which of course is now full of typos as it couldnt been seen on screen during entry fullout crashes with regularity attempting a factory reset which really shouldnt be necessary for a phone that was brand new and is less than a month old,0,0,0
i had problems with this phone being able to use apps with data on tracfone after an elevated call with customer service we found the apn was incorrect which lead to this particular issue other than that i love the phone the phone worked fine for a month until it randomly had the apn issue after an automatic service refill weird good photos slim design large vibrant screen solid buy when its on sale if you are a budget phone user,0,1,0

definitely a used phone mild scratches on the screen but not deep enough to affect function battery isnt the best for a full day unless your not using it that much pen nib was bent ordered new and screen looked like it had glue or sealant around the edges swipe texting lags almost like the input cant keep up with the pen stroke,0,0,0
i really like the phone but dont buy ive contacted the seller repeatedly to take the phone back i paid for a unlocked samsung which makes it much higher priced this phone is locked to att and unfortunately for me i dont get service so dont buy unless you plan on staying with att its falsely advertised the seller will not take it back,0,0,0
the phone worked fine for months then all of a sudden it was stuck on a black screen with error slot unbootable load error with options for recovery restart and perhaps other options but i cant see those now as it will not even turn on now selecting any of these options simply returns back to the same exact screen all of this would be fine as the product page says it comes with a us warranty and this looks to be just a lemon which does happen with technology and tends to be the purpose of these warranties unfortunately the seller claims this warranty is through google and google only has warranties for authorized resellers which i have been informed that this seller is not i will continue to reach out until this has been resolved and am hopeful an exchangerefund is possible as i would not have bought a phone with no warranty and just being out is no fun,0,0,0
the only reason this was a star and not a star monitor is the inability to sync the webcam i was also hoping to use this monitor for zoom and for some reason the zoom app is not available i was also unable to adjust monitor settings like brightness i like how big the monitor is i can have two documents side by side and read them easily or have two windows open and work simultaneously the picture is very clear being able to sync streaming services is a big plus,0,1,0
there were problems with getting it delivered on time which the company did not do well but i guess thats more on fault of the delivery service being separate i was too pampered by free sameday delivery in china i suppose but the machine had problems with heat that my previous s did not have and it seemed to pause at times i know people dont usually read manuals anymore but mine was in malay or something that doesnt matter as much as the plug also being in the south east asian style rather than any actual international style and even the usb cord was for the older samsung phones not the current one so i had to use one of my spares all in all a lot of problems and not very good communication on the companys side either,0,0,0

didnt want to sign a contract with a major phone company plus i wanted sometime by the very next day cause my s finally decided to hit the dust and flat out stopped turning on i didnt want to spend over either i was happy with my s and didnt need anything super fancy so i went with the s ive been very happy with it since i got it been about months now it was easy to switch over to consumer cellular as an unlocked phone my only complaint is sometimes very rarely it shuts off it can be due to it maybe having to much running in the background and i forgetting to close aps that are running its done this about times since ive had it which isnt bad i think other than that its been working great,0,1,1

i bought this in january so i would have a backup phone i just now started using it it is a piece of trash the touch screen will not work it will not detect the sd card and unfortunately i am a past my warranty time just warning to you all do not buy this piece of garbage,0,0,0
so i was a little nervous about buying these because the wireless earbud market right now is not great for those of us who dont want airpods i saw these were rated the best on some website so i thought i would give them a try jabra themselves handled the refurbishment so i was confident i would not end up with a bad or misused product it arrived the next day holy cow fast serviceand i discovered that not only are these way better than i thought they may be the best wireless earbuds on the market first the good they have some noise cancelling technology i was vacuuming most of the day yesterday and could barely hear the vacuum with these in they come with an app that lets you set the eq settings which is great sound quality on them is excellent the app also features soundscapes like rain or white noise and it has built in find my jabra tech so you wont lose them once they are on and synced you can just take them out and put them in your ear with out fiddling with them the hear through feature is nice and nonintrusive but doesnt always work for speech if music is playing what is a nice feature is if you take one out while talking or to talk to some one it pauses the music for you the battery life is great the buds get a five hour charge and a fully charged case will give you two charges fifteen hours crazy good now for the bad i cant save my custom eq settings they can get uncomfortable during a prolonged use hours but not too painful to use the buttons on the side are a little stiff when skipping songs or increasing volume otherwise this was a smart purchase and i heartily recommend to any one considering take the plunge they are totally worth it,0,1,1

the biggest problem is turning the yv on to often get a blank screen instead of the hdmi channel with my trusty roku on it the only thing i ever use the tv knows its there but upon choosing it repeatedly still blank the roku is on and responding to its remote it has its own flashing light still nothing and this is in my bedroom where i go when im tired grrr and i agree with the others the sound is subpar,0,0,0
i bought this phone to replace the same version it came completely dead which i thought was odd then after charging it for hours it only went up to battery then i picked it up and the phone was burning hot i have the same version of the phone already and i know it will charge in under an hour and never get hot like that its so much work to move all the apps and change everything over im beyond angry,0,0,0
if youve never purchased an unlocked phone make you have a sim card to use in this case i didnt have one that would work for this phone it took far longer than it should have to get it activated it wasnt the phone it was the different carriers i went to both complained that unlocked phones could be tricky etc it wasnt that it was the lack of support knowledge which transferred when i called my carriers customer service thankfully i finally got it activated its an awesome phone,0,2,1
im not impressed at all with this tv color isnt that great and is not easy to use a lot more steps to get into different apps wish the remote was laid out better,0,0,0
i originally bought this for my son to replace his blu r hd but he didnt care for it because the screen is too bright so i sat on it till my phone got stolen and i decided to switch over to this phone my phone service is through att and this phone is not really compatible with what they have going on according to att i need to get a new phone soon because its not going to work after they do some system update is what i was told anyway my biggest issue with it is i cant access any of my apps in the google play store to update them and even though i have automatic update selected it doesnt always work for all the apps one for sure it doesnt work on is google chrome and pinterest but the rest of the apps if you go to the google play store and search them you can update from that screen i also noticed quite a few times the time gets stuck on this like itll say and its actually the only way that i can fix that is to turn it off and turn it back on again the screen is really bright the battery is completely amazing it lasts forever and its durable because ive dropped it way too many times and the only problem i have is the glass protector screen they sent me has a crack in it but not the actual screen also the cameras kind of crappy and the filters dont work,0,0,0
nope i got this phone two weeks ago used for instead of paying for a new one huge mistake it said it was like new and showed signs of light use which is bs cause it completely sucks the charger it came with wasnt an htc charger it sucked wouldnt stay clicked into phone so if the phone moved at all even the tiniest bit when the charger was inside itd slip out and stop charging you gotta hold it at just the right angle and when you let go it stops charging like usually after a while the chargers get like that but from the start it was already like broken then the battery was terrible took so long for it to charge and within minutes it would drop down id charge my phone all night and wake up in the morning to it one hundred percent so id take it off and within like ten minutes its at okay those problems are annoying but what made me write this review was what happened today omg im so mad so my phone dies completely and turns off cause the battery sucks so i charged it while it was off till it was and go to turn it back on and this stupid white screen pops up that says locked and gives me options like system reboot factory reset lock sim but from the start the phones down button never worked so im using the up button to scroll through the options and in the screen it said power was to select but when id try it wouldnt do anything except stay on that stupid lock screen i had to call virgin mobile and since i couldnt get the msnidi think thats what its called the long barcode that every phone has customer service couldnt do anything for me they were like u can get the number off the box and the seller never sent me the box so theres no way for them to even connect to my phone so they give me htcs number and i had to call and talk to them and after about minutes of being passed around and put on hold a million times they did something to where i thought it was fixed cause the tech dude got my phone to reboot and i thought it was over but sure enough later in the day my phone died again and i got the same lock screen bs but of course after tech support is closed so this phone sucks used i basically threw in the trash do not buy unless youre buying it brand new,0,0,0
pretty to look at but piece of crap did arrive with all the bits n pieces powered up but then went haywirecrazy continuously flashing from screen to screen with no way to access the power off or reset buttons to shut it off unable to do a forced reboot unable to successfully boot in recovery mode unable to do a master reset as im on an international flight in less than hours and not back stateside for a while have no time to deal with returns basically a waste of money dont waste yours learn from the almost star reviews of total reviews on this itemsupplier samsung galaxy s gb unlocked phone international version maple gold mobiles international llc,0,0,0
stunning to look at but would not advise buying this phone quick enough to be fair but nothing special became laggy less impressive as the weeks passed after just months use i managed to drop mine in a case from less than off floor and screen cracked top to bottomhaving searched forums im not the only one with same experience yes i know should have been more careful but a premium phone should be more robust in my opinion i fear the curved edges result in a more fragile screen back to boring screen edges for me to be fair in use the screen edge bevel was more hindrance than helpbut looks stunning the choice is yoursform or function,0,0,0
tldr for lightmoderate use in very careful hands even with a case not for phone enthusiasts people who like customisingrooting do online banking or butterfingers if youve ever broken even one of your previous phones just look elsewhere maybe even at just a cheaper model worst customer service in history the weeks i used the phone sd card would not mount and read as internal storage only external dont know if that was a defect or something to do with their os tweaks annoying but not awful with the gb internal cant root this phone though i cant remember if it was because of their os or the malware bloatware takes up more space than youd expect reception with tmobile was just a little worse than my iphone about a bar change not awful fingerprint sensor worked about of the time but maybe my hands were too small for it sometimes people said it sounded like i was in a tunnel with the phone to my ear but not always couldve been something other than the phone bought of these one for me one for my grandma back in feb we both put cases on our phones my grandma has had issues with this phone she does light usage no more than hrs a day talktextwebetc she didnt buy an extended warranty doesnt hold the phone much and she loves it she upgraded from a samsung s or she feels banking on a phone is insecure anyway so she doesnt mind not being able to use it for bills etc when i launched the phone the first thing i did was buy the extended warrantyinsurance through the blu help app on the phone thats where the excitement about buying a new phone ended for me as right away i got no info about the warrantyinsurance even though the money was pulled out of my account not even the name of the company which i found very odd i had the phone for weeks before i dropped it i knew that would happen i break my phones very regularly so i wasnt too upset but i was surprised how much damage it caused the phone i was seated and it fell on tile and not only did the screen crack but the whole battery door got damaged as well it bent at the side buttons so its impossible to use any of them called blu for help to see who the insurer was they said they dont know dont offer buying warranties through their phones and cant be any further helprudely i might add and none of the women who tried to help me would listen to my problem they kept trying to give me solutions to other problems i didnt have after putting me on hold for min intervals without listening to what i was saying this was a while back but the specific instance i remember was i started out saying my screen wasnt working and before i could even say it was cracked she put me on hold and came back talking about how the phone might be defective no a screen crack isnt a defect that situation happened more times with the various women i was pretty upset then that blu couldnt tell me who was selling warrantiesinsurance on their own devices they told me to email blu instead of call never got a response called amazon they couldnt help me either in august i got an email from worth ave group with my info for my insurance then about weeks later i got an email with updated warranty info and they had downgraded my insurance from what i paid for so months between purchase of insurance before i got anything about my policy half the life of the policy was gone before i could maybe make a claim as soon as the info came in i tried to put a claim through impossible you call themcant access the website then they call you backyou have to leave a voicemail so i called numerous times different days at different times never heard anything back blu couldnt help they are known for shipping with malware and no phone ive ever had has broken so easilyexcept the iphone whose screen just randomly fell off the first week it was maybe a ft drop and the phone is literally unusable cracked all over unresponsive and like i said the battery door is broken so you cant even turn the screen off in order to fix the phone id have to find a battery door and a screen which leads to another downmark on this phone zero aftermarket parts for this phone even a website i saw through forums that was supposed official blu phone parts had no battery door covers of any kind and didnt offer a white screen only black so the rose gold version i purchased couldnt be restored anyway if you spend the money on an old samsunglgiphone at least you can fix certain things like if the screen cracks without worrying about warranties or bad customer service all that said i ordered the blu vivo xl used to replace this one for like at least if its destroyed its cheap to replace without worrying just like i have no trouble buying a zte phone if im in between phones and in a pinch a throwaway phone is a throwaway phone but such a nice flagship model shouldnt be forced into throwaway status because of such awful customer service all around overall its okay hours a day being all it can handle is a little annoying for just steer clear of their customer service and you probably wont hate it but its not a star phone,0,0,0
when i initially opened the box i was like wow this thing is brand new but when i went to turn it on it wouldnt even turn on so i was like wtf so i figured it must be completely dead so i went to charge it with the included charger and ctype cable and the it wouldnt go all the way in so i got a magnifying glass and looked at the charging port and there was all kinds of sand in it so i took a small pipe cleaning brush using some rubbing alcohol to clean the port out and let me tell you there was all kinds of crap in the charging port but i did finally get cleaned out with that and a can air then after that i let sit out for a few hours before trying to insert the ctype charging cable into the charging port and when i finally did that the ctype charging cable went easily into the charging port and the phone reported battery level and it took nearly hours to charge the phone crazy anyway for phone that is supposed to be renewed one shouldnt have to go through all that i had to go through anyway the phone is working now but battery performance isnt great i have it just sitting on the counter and i havent done anything with it no call no texts no nothing and in hours time it is down to which is all kinds of bad anyway i think i need to check the batteries performance level because my old pixel xl which i have sitting next to this renewed phone is at running the same apps as this renewed phone yeah i am thinking i just a renewed phone that was heavily used and the battery cant hold a very good charge anymore,0,0,0
ok so the battery never lasts more than hours an alert about the case not being closed and another for the charge port cover pop up all day probably draining the poor battery too if i have it in use for a minute phone call it dies as soon as i take it off charge it says minutes later the camera is impossible to focus its totally low quality waste of money really i thought i upgraded i had ztes before their battery seems to work great for months this phone the battery was a problem within days it came with weird advertising websites which seemed too pop up all the time on their own stuff i would have never searched for bad phone from day,0,0,0

horrible workmanship ive ben using cell phones since years and have never run into such a cheaply constructed piece of plastic whats worse it is impossible to pry open the case to install the battery i even went to youtube for guidance and believe it there were videos on how to pry open the tribute but the phone used on youtube and this one are not the same the one they show does have a thumb nail slot the tribute does not have a thumb nail slot even the phones instructions omit the concept of opening the phone you know how they detail a phones features with a graphic there is no mention in the manual about a slot or opening for prying the case apart so i sent it right back i tried for an hour too the worst phone imaginable avoid,0,0,0
i bought an external keyboard to go with this because i thought it would be too hard to type on screen but for ordinary text im not finding that an issue i still use the keyboard with more programming related typing which i do from time to time but not regularly from my phone as shipped it has very aggressive background task termination which is very much not what i want in a phone this is easy to disable from settings and things like my pedometer app actually work but now i find the battery really doesnt last very long also as shipped theres no way to take a photo without unlocking the phone i installed a paid app called lockscreen widgets and put a take photo widget on the lockscreen which solved that im okay with very small text and thats what i get with this device not recommended for people who need reading glasses,0,0,0
we bought another pro max from one of amazons other refurbished companies woot it was about cheaper very badly redone and was not excellent as described they had replaced the screen and did not install it properly it was so warped that it would not take a glass screen saver anyway its on the way back to amazon we bought this one from amazon renewed they called it a refurbished premium definitely the way to go it looks like its brand new awesome job love it,0,0,1

i purchased this phone and i have had it for more than a year in that time anytime the phone updates it will make out the storage as though it is redownloading the os over and over again i have had to save my info via google and then factory reset the phone about every other month it is time consuming and i am just too cheap to buy a new phone but it continues to be an issue that may force me into buying something new,0,0,0
its a broken system that im frankly flabbergasted is still available for sale the first update locks the screen to just the firetv logo and thats it you now own a waste of space per tcl there is no possible way to reset it from this point no factory reset options exist preboot and i searched extensively their support is wildly unavailable and difficult to work with once you get in touch do not buy,0,0,0
ive been looking for a while to find earbuds that are comfortable and work for me and ive found that i struggle with earbuds that use silicone tips these earbuds fulfill all my expectations growing up i used the older ipod earbuds that were corded and didnt have silicone tips since i have a samsung phone it didnt make sense to get airpods plus the cost of airpods is atrocious these have the same basic principle and form factor as airpods in the relative size of airpods gen at about half the cost theres only one feature i wish these had and thats tile functionality the skullcandy sesh evo had this feature at less than where these earbuds were about nevertheless im rating these stars for exceeding my expectations,0,2,1
i use earbuds at work daily and i am pretty rough on them i go through pairs a year because they eventually get shorts in them and have to be replaced i had never heard of ulix before purchasing these i wasnt expecting much considering they have a standard sized cord that is wrapped in a fabric material so far this is the longest lasting pair of earbuds i have used in the past years incredible ive had them for a little over months and havent noticed any signs of wear the braided nature of the cord seems to make them less likely to kink up the plug connector which is where most of mine have failed over the years is low profile and strong i think its small footprint also has played a part in their longevity the sound quality is great for my purposes they even cancel out some of the outside noise when you wear them i havent personally used the call and volume controls but i would suspect they are on point as well what i really enjoy is that they back their products with a year warranty that says a lot about their faith in their products they also include a nice little seemingly handwritten note thanking me for my support of their business it is little things like that that really set this pair of earbuds apart from the pack im a fan of ulix and as long as these hold up or their warranty holds true i will be a long term customer of their brand,0,2,1

i bought this renewed phone after my last pixel a had a battery issue it was working perfectly these last couple months until i recently got a battery indicator saying problem finding your battery meter and it left a question mark on my battery status it kept doing it on and off even after the android update just a week ago the battery just died on me and have to get my battery fixed it would take longer getting it done by google so i will just return it,0,0,0

update this tv is worse than i thought because it links to your google assistant you randomly lose control we were in the middle of a show and i opened pandora on my phone and for some reason it also opened on my tv i wish i could return this for a refund dont buy this i setup the tv and turned it on only to find out i couldnt stream any apps unless i setup and linked it to a google home account annoying but shame on me for not reading more thoroughly i finally figured that out and then i went to use it only to find out i needed to setup and create a tcl accountabsolute pain and ridiculous that i needed to create and link two accounts to use my streaming apps im under and pretty tech savvy i just hate having to link so many accounts just to stream hbo netflix etc when nothing has to do with google or tcl ultimately they just want your data so they can sell it rant over but i would never buy this tv again,0,0,0

very disappointed with the seller of this phone they advertised the product like factory unlocked but in reality is not i used the phone in europe and i have a lot of problems with the carrier the phone was a att phone which was rooted i tried to update to the latest software version and guess whatnot possible the phone conected to the att server for a update and just a few seconds the update was interrupted this makes me very unhappyi will never buy anything from this guys again,0,0,0

i didnt want to write this but i want to be helpful to others these headphones were the best ive owned in quality connectivity design and sound while they worked unfortunately they started having charging issues after about months i contacted customer service and they agreed to replace them under the warranty as long as i would destroy my current set which worked but not perfectly and prove to them the destruction i did and they shipped me a set but it was an older model that is currently being sold as renewed on amazon the name is exactly the same which is annoying but the specs are clearly inferior the design is different and the date on the box is two years older vs i contacted customer service and they apologized saying that it was a logistics department mistake i sent the replacement set back at their expense and waited for replacement set now two weeks after i destroyed my original purchase today i received replacement set and its the same model with inferior specs not the model i purchased in late i can no longer give them the benefit that this was a mistake instead it appears to be a decision to clean out the warehouse rather than honor the products warranty if i ever receive a true replacement for the product i purchased i will return and attempt to update this review but ive lost patience and hope others do not face the same frustration update on the third attempt i was sent a true replacement of the ordered product and told that i could keep the prior version that i had been sent by mistake based on this ive increased the rating from a to a the hassle of replacement and the fact that it had to be replaced within a year keeps it from stars but the quality when it works and the ultimate backing of their customer service are positives,0,0,0
i bought the phone and it was nice but has one problem that my husband did not like it did turned off and didnt wanna turn on when somebody was calling so i ruterned the phone i did ask the seller to send me a new one and they did but it was the same phone it even had my babys picture which we took the first time we used the phone to see the quality of camera and charger was folded the same way i did it and did not have plastic covers and black cover from front and back of the phone were put there for the second time for sure but they stil keep telling me it was a new phone so please buy the phone but not from this seller because the phone is good but service is awfull and they refunded money but took off the price i paid originaly because they say it was a new phone,0,0,0

very disappointing they claimed they went through the laptop they didnt because it wouldnt even turn on amazon was nice enough to have it pick up at my apartment now im going to spend more money in make sure i do not oder it from the same company the laptop was what i was looking for was going to oder a new one but i dont want to deal with the same company cant trust them to bad makes amazon look bad but i know it not them they stand behind what they say and they did going to give me credit and i will buy a different laptop from a different company thank you amazon,0,0,0
the sound quality and volume levels are not great but acceptable given the price of the ear buds however i would have expected them to last longer than days i would definitely not recommend them i revised my review to stars since the seller reached out to me multiple times to resolve the issue they seemed determined to improve their product quality and offered multiple options to resolve my issue my opinion of the product has not changed based on my experience but i would be very comfortable recommending this seller products can sometimes be defective but most important is the trust that the seller will stand behind the product and ensure the customer is satisfied,0,0,0

very nice phone a little bit taller than my note removed the goo and added apk pure first set it up on wifi for the updates and the apps i use transferred my contacts with contact backup inserted the g sim card verizon noticed the new phone and chatted online asked for the imei and the icc number did a test call and all is good may still need to get a g sim card but for now it works got some more line discounts when i byou bought with glass shield and outer case hope to get another years out of this phone as well,2,1,1

i really love the galaxy note and i have had absolutely no problems with it it does everything and more i am sorry the newest version has been such a disaster but i think there must have been a flaw in the sealed waterproof design i am so glad i settled on the older version tried and true for less money and virtually no down side at all the galaxy note phone is such an awesome phone i feel very badly for the company at this time also the company which sent it did so quickly arrived earlier than expected,2,2,1
i like to say first of all how comfortable they are number the sound quality is ridiculous is actually better than my beats headset period the one cool feature about the app for soundcore is that it actually gives you a hearing test and adjust to pass suit youre hearing which is fantastic i hear everything it even showed me that my left ear doesnt hear as well as my right which i kinda knew since i damage my eardrum in a diving accident when i was serving as a navy deep sea diver i love these i highly recommend them,2,2,1
i think this is overall a very solid phone its one of the best performing android phones i have owned and probably closest to the lumia which i have been trying to find a comparable replacement for since the battery died in mine and microsoft killed their mobile os would honestly be a star rating overall at the regular price for me dinging it on the point that most phones suffer from these days in that they are overpriced for their performance levels and features these days but if you can get it on sale for around that is a price i am in much more comfortable recommending than at the dollar original price,2,2,1
we are very pleased with this tv i do have to say if you have any sunlight that shines near the tv the picture is hard to see and it produces a glare other then that the picture is crisp and the sound bar is plenty loud even with out children playing around us we never have a problem hearing the tv the tv was easy to install and so far well worth the money,2,2,1
i love this phone so much i would hundred percent guarantee if youre looking for a cheap phone but you only have to spare buy this phone it comes with an on screen fingerprint scanner a very good for cameras but you do need a lot of light for it the only problem i had for this phone is that it has no nfc but since i will not be making any payments or needing to share anything im really not mad there is tax on the phone that is so that room that is i mean that will bring your phone up to,2,1,1
the good its a great gaming laptop fast very nice graphics good price point the ugly the speakers are not very loud so will buy headphones the bad it has some multi colored keys that frankly in high light conditions make it hard to see but they have a app and so i set all the keys to white and that kinda fixes it its a lot of steps to get rid of the colors but its there would not buy again just find these specs with a normal backlit keyboard,2,1,0
awesome tv for a good price looks great in my living room would give it stars but it randomly turns my playstation on and switches to that hdmi channel for no reason and thats just annoying had to unplug the hdmi to make it stop first world problems,2,2,1

im a blackberry nut for some reason i just like having a physical keyboard for one i also think it their products are well made and innovatively different ive had pearl flip phone and a curve before this i had the curve for about years and loved it at the end it didnt seem to hold a charge anymore id gladly have bought another one but they dont make them anymore the bb os on it worked perfectly for me a small but very efficient phone for call emails texts and many other uses the trackpad keyboard and blackberry button for menus worked perfect so did the removable battery i didnt care about its mediocre internet browsing or game playing or camera taking capabilities when i went to the tmobile store they didnt sell bb anymore so i just took a chance and ordered this q its a discontinued unlocked phone i had seen it several years ago when it sold for i believe i paid about brand new in a box with an at and t and logo i just put a sim card in and it worked fine i updated it to the current system their is a learning curve with this phone its more sophisticated the curve and trickier to use without the trackball and blackberry button after about months of use im more comfortable with it but sometimes use the wrong gesture the hub is nice once you know what it does and how to navigate with it the browser is way better than the curve most things are better than the curve just not as easy to navigate its also bigger than the curve but way smaller than the passport and a bit smaller than the classic for what was available for a reasonable price this was the right choice for me and im glad i bought it the accesories are dirt cheap also i hope it lasts a long time i think the current bbs are more like android phones and the build quality isnt as great when i first got the phone my battery charger seemed to last about a day and a half recently it seems to have declined to almost a day im not sure why i just ordered new batteries to see if that helps id be bummed if the phone was already acting up ive also had a bbplaybook for years and its still going strong with heavy usage i expect the same with this wonderful blackberry product in many was its the perfect phone in the perfect size canada has at least great things ice hockey and blackberries,2,2,1
this is for the fire inch im very pleased arrived fast and in great condition very easy setup especially since i already had an amazon account great picture with k sure beats going to a store thanks amazon,2,2,1

very nice phone for under i had the g before this and only upgraded after i finally killed the g by dropping it the camera is very nice high resolution screen and good fingerprint reader the phone is quick and i havent noticed any lag it comes with a basic plastic case and screen protector in addition to a charger and headphones i seriously doubt that the battery will actually last for days like they claim unless you hardly use the phone but im also it wont die in under a day with normal use so far this phone seems to stand up to blus normal standard of quality and useability came online with my net sim card immediately without any hiccups for anyone who is wondering these phones will work with just about any carrier except verizon grab one before theyre gone,2,2,1
great experience and picture quality,2,2,1
this smart phone is exceeding my expectations on speed responsiveness and features over a month owned and has performed flawlessly no fingerprint sensor but honestly i was having issues with apps closing due on my old moto e fingerprint scanning in error i use the pattern to unlock which is simple and quick to unlock my moto e play buy it while you can highly recommended,2,2,1
i was very happy with my galaxy s and thus had not considered upgrading until now with g being rolled out for real in many locations i was quite surprised however when i began using the multiple camera format of this device because i was convinced that improvements to the s camera were unlikely whoa so wrong the range of photographing capabilities have been significantly advanced in this model and i coudnt be happier with the results im seeing ai is in its infancy yet there are applications in the camera of this device that offer real advantages with impressive results also the much larger battery is doing a much better job of reaching the end of my typical day with power remaining for my purposes i am very glad that i decided to upgrade to the s and i highly recommend this model,2,2,1
i bought this cheap phone to use as a music player while ive purchased dedicated music players in the past with varying degrees of satisfaction i have found that a cheap cell phone excels works equally well or better my only issue with this particular phone is that the volume increments are not accurately spaced while the volume is adjustable there are times when its impossible to get the ideal volume level its either too high or too low but i found a volume control app online that mitigates the problem quite well,2,1,1
camera is great on this phone if you switch between apps the bluetooth connection will drop,2,1,1
student bought for college and i love it never had any issues with it runs games really well and doesnt crash or give me any issues when downloading modifications for anything either it lasts me all day during classes and has a great screen both for gaming and for my examshomeworkessays,2,2,1

was leary purchasing refurbished but ive had no real problems except the face recognition feature doesnt like me but the biometric readers are great and more secure anyways battery life isnt great but not completely horrible just trying to get to where i knowunderstand the samsung features as most arent syncable with previous features but thats part of the process,2,1,1
i dont often write reviews or give ratings but this product deserves it the lg inch class oled evo k is remarkable and at times has me memorized the pixel smoothing and detail is transformational and quickly transports you to the location on the screen i know im being wordy but really if you appreciate screen quality then this is the correct choice zero glare and picture quality that seems almost un improvable makes this the kind of experience you only get experience once i dont know how much better an k television can be and id never spend the extra money to find out because at best it would be marginal youll be happy like me with this purcashe,2,2,1
great phone for the price,2,2,1
very pleased needed to purchase a laptop to work from home it arrived super fast easy set up perfect for my needs seller was awesome,2,2,1
its a very good phone i brought this for my husband and he loves it highly recommend for anyone needing a good phone from att who is on a budget,2,2,1
if there was a flaw i couldnt find it looks and acts brand new worked seamlessly with our carrier tracfone super happy with this purchase,2,2,1
skeptical of the quality over time bought this to test it the hardware so far is rock solid phone is of exceptional build quality the screen fold is hardly noticeable the hinge feels firm when opening and closing the sound is decent the camera is great and it fits in my pocket however once you open up the flip whats on the screen just ruins the whole experience samsungs one ui they created is as bad as getting a phone from your carrier loaded with paid crap they shove onto it that slows it down and eats up your storage space and makes things way more difficult than they need to be until you just want to throw it away google already has most of the things in their android os base that you need samsung just recreates most of them badly the phone app lacks features the native android version has the messages app tries to make it look like imessage and theres the samsung store which is pushed upon you for all sorts of things from setting a background picture to installing more samsung apps you have no use for theres loads of features that are only available when you log the phone in to your samsung account i really dont need another worthless account to log my phone into thanks thankfully theres some really slick people at xda developers who make some programs that will allow you to disable all the bloatware and bs that comes on this phone as i have yes sixty one disabled samsung apps on this phone just to get it debloated and running smooth and fast and extend the battery life to what could be considered marginal without it i was out of battery by pm as every samsung app keeps trying to do something in the background all day long draining your battery if they had a clean install button that took out all the sht it would make this phone a immediately further time will tell on the fold and how that holds up over time,2,1,0
excellent phone for the pricei havent used all the features theres a lot to phone i find tutorials on youtube great value for the money camera resolution on it is way better than any phone for this price,2,2,1
surprisingly easy to use and the system is fluent,2,2,1
good phone i like it reasonable price,2,2,1
i was a little hesitant to move to an arm based processor after doing some research watching reviews and looking at the applications i needed i felt confident in purchasing everything has worked really well i also purchased a tb micro ssd to put movies on as i plan to travel a lot battery lasts a long time without sacrificing performance,2,2,1
the unboxed the tv hooked it up and took the trash away they were both very pleasant and a pleasure to deal with aaaaa thank you,2,2,1
fingerprint reader works great until you add a screen protector then forget it my old s had the reader on the back and avoided this issue cant understand why they took something that worked well and changed it i also preferred the screen press over the double tap to wake the phone up battery life memory camera etc are all great and i recommend this phone as long as fingerprint reader is not a deal breaker for you the phone is like new and the delivery was fast would buy again from this seller,2,2,1
i bought this phone months ago and really like it its a fantastic value for the price was really happy with the phone then i updated to android i really wish i hadnt and you cant roll back the wifi has become glitchy the battery life is still good but not quite as good and the phone overall moves slower i dont see a single improvement or benefit to android im writing this as a caution to those who havent upgraded yet anyone else having issues since upgrading this phone,2,1,1
convenient charger and the common charging plug nice looking case,2,2,1
have only had it for a couple of days but great battery life easy to move all my stuff from old galaxy phone to this one great value for the price,2,2,1
the phone arrived with the original packaging paper inserts usbc cable and warp charger everything it came with looked like it had never been used and works perfectly the battery life has been excellent and the warp charger charges the phone from in less than minutes,2,2,1
i really like this phone for the price it works just as well as my nexus that i had previously used the camera is not very great but decent the size is perfect the sound is ok i feel the volume on loud speaker could be better i enjoy the pink color which is fun only regret is not purchasing the lte version i maybe doing that soon so the data speed is faster i am currently using the cricket plan and i am satisfied,2,1,1
it was easy to set up ive added wireless mouse because im a writer but touch screen functioned well during set up screen quality is very good light as a feather,2,2,1
phone works great so far for voice text uber banking apps social media everything else an expensive smart phone does good cameras too,2,2,1
this is my first smartphone and it seems to meet my needs wish it came with a little more detailed users manual but overall i am satisfied with my purchase,2,2,1
the picture image is excellent i have used a dvd player vcr and external hard drive through it they all look good the only thing wrong with it is the internal speakers they sound cheesy and are located at the bottom of the of the screen so the sound direction is down if sitting on a table this is not good sound direction you will need to buy external speakers and an amp to improve the sound quality it will not work with wireless speakers except with the roku wireless speakers using an antenna for local overair is fine some of the roku channels bring local stations many roku channel choices if you want to pay a fee then you can get more channels,2,1,1
in the past few years ive used many phones i admit it im somewhat of a phone geek from several versions of android phones to every version of iphone except the iphone and ive always liked blackberry due to the physical keyboard it used to have and because os works for me on my z and z but i started to feel that blackberry was starting to become just another touch screen phone that looked and felt like the rest the passport changed all of that this phone is what blackberry should have come out with a few years ago when it was being kicked to the curb by many it has an incredible keyboard that looks odd and makes you wonder if you can use it after typing on a screen for so long but it is unlike any other keyboard in that it surprisingly took zero time to get used to it the square size poses no problems for me it fits just fine in my rear pants pocket and feels just fine when holding it as a matter of fact it is easier to use because of its odd shape of course it isnt really a onehanded type of phone if you have smallish hands my hands are average and ive always used two hands when typing or dialing on a cell phone so for me the whole not a phone you can use one handed is a moot point the build quality is like all other blackberry phones top notch you can feel a heft but not enough to make you wish it was lighter the os is slick fast and incredibly responsive to any command i give it the battery has to be the best out there i charge my phone over night and unplug it at around am every morning i make a lot of calls and text quite a bit throughout the day it still has battery power at the end of my day which is around pm and i used to be impressed with having power left on my iphone s the whole package is just right for me easy to use well balanced comfortable and good looking if you are looking for something new with a touch of vintage that the keyboard gives it and an incredible os that is seamless and predictably easy to master go for the passport the only negative is that there are not too many accessories available for it,2,2,1
product was shipped on time looks and works like new,2,2,1
i love it so much its the perfect size for my dresser and works great,2,2,1
its a nice tight squeeze on my s great pricing for an official product and look so lovely i mean the way the way it glows when light goes into it cant go wrong with it really only bad thing i see is that its not got amazing protection anything above chest hight is risking it but yeah me gusto,2,2,1
first off i was skeptical about ordering a refurbished s ultra gb titanium phantom honestly i was pleasantly surprised by how clean it is it really looks and feels like a brand new phone i tried to find flaws in it but i couldnt not a single scratch the phone is extremely fast can multitask easily without compromises to speed it does get a little warm when youre multitasking but not to the point where you cant hold it i wouldnt expect anything else frankly battery life so far is very impressive ive been heavily using it since am its currently am like updating the software twice social media texting etc and its currently at after a full nights charge fingerprint sensor is good need to get used to its position on the screen and remembering its not on the back panel anymore i did have to reregister my fingerprints a few times after noticing that it doesnt recognize it if my thumb is at a weird angle face id is good although i rely on my fingerprints more in terms of the phone capability you already know how amazing it is if youre considering buying it overall impressed so far,2,2,1
my father is very satisfied,2,2,1
these phones and plans are perfect for my year old daughter i have the ability to track all of her activity and can cancel the plan at anytime if she needs to have the fun taken away,2,2,1
works great at a fair price,2,2,1
the phone was delivered in good condition without the original box it worked fine during initial setup had to return since i found a cheaper vendor and new one was delivered in better condition,2,1,1
i had to replace my intuition due to dropping it so i had to pay cash for this one ok i used my amazon credit card so far i think that it was worth the dollars it does everything that my old phone did only better it also has some pretty cool features like when its hibernating i can run my hand across the top and it will give me the time startled me the first time because it was in the morning and i was getting a drink of water off the night stand but it made a great night light so far good to go,2,2,1
great phone love everything about it,2,2,1
i initially submitted a star due to not receiving the product when advertised i finally received it and very satisfied with this laptop speed is excellent several different apps to utilize and user friendly the only issue and it is only mine is the default s mode that the laptop had on it this app i guess is for security and you can only get ms approved apps out of the store since i use another browser not in the app store the laptop would not let me install the browser app not good for me so i turned off this s mode app but it was kind of a pain to find it and turn off other than that very good product,2,2,1
for the cost especially when on sale under these are the best earbuds with anc for under and they are well under great battery life reasonably decent anc for most people great and easy connectivity and really nice sound decent bass mids and highs a pretty flat curve with a bit more bass punch youd expect in mainstream headphones overall i can say enough after almost months of owning they are still great,2,2,1
im not the kind of person that needs the latest and best flagship phone out on the market i try to buy the best quality for my money this phone so far i find impressive it has a finger print scan which is nice and does everything youd expect a phone to do if you are looking for a phone that is under that you wont be disappointed with then buy this one its great,2,2,1

gigs of system mem already used up as shipped gigs of apps and it says and change used with available hrmph gig phone hmmmmm also do not stick anything in the small hole next to the sim chip holder think of it as your ear do not stick anything in your ear this is the microphone port and if you jam something in there you can break the dust cover or your eardrum transferring contacts can be unholy hell fwiw this is what i did after all of the account setting failures teeth gnashing and hair pulling contacts are transferred using a universal contact file format called vcf go to the contact app in the old device and export that file using the export feature in settings i exported to an sd card on a samsung g highlight the file and then email it to yourself using the share feature then go to the ph and the contacts app and import it the import feature will search locally foryou guessed itany vcf file and if you downloaded it from your email then it will find it none of this shows up in forums or youtubes or help files so im glad im smart no brightness slider but im not done looking or configuring the phone i might try another skin i like the skin on a samsung g more than the stock skin on this ph for me its pretty blingy i got a carbon fiber glove for bucks it has titanium and ceramic it is about the same weight and size as my galaxy g i got it on the most recent sale from amazon plus tax brought it to plus the carbon glove i hope to be happy with it i would probably have been happy with like a refurb galaxy or something for less than ill update in a week or so i did let the software update to and havent had any crashing or freezing so thats nice,1,1,1

i purchased this phone months ago ive been a long time xiaomi supporter this is probably my th phone well a week or so ago the phone started to drop signal i thought it might have been a service issue but it kept doing it so i contacted my carrier they said it was not on there end a few days after the phone started to boot loop over and over again out of no where sometimes it will boot all the way up then out of no where reboot so i did a factory reset at least times and still no progress i took it to a local phone repair shop and got diagnosed with a faulty chip inside they didnt state which one so i contacted the manufacturer xiaomi they told me to do the whole factory reset thing after i told them that has already been done and ive got it diagnosed by a repair shop they made it clear they have zero certified dealers or trusted sellers in the usa there for no xiaomi product sold in the usa will be covered under a manufactured warranty now i have a new phone i cant use and no help from the company who made it i just wanted to let everyone know to be careful if you buy this phone or any xiaomi products and live in the usa that you will have no manufactured help if the product is faulty i think it would be a good idea that the seller states that in the future for its customers i know they stated no warranty on there end but to have no manufactured warranty on a brand new item is mind blowing,1,0,0
i dont buy phones often i prefer to keep my phone running as long as i can until it simply doesnt work any more sure im a tech enthusiast but i also dont need the latest technology every year i just need something that is reliable practical and wont become ewaste in a year for some reason phones keep getting bigger every year because bigger is better but my hands havent increased in size since my childhood last i checked so this trend is just bizarre to me fortunately sony is still making relatively reasonablesized phones for my unmanly ladysized hands that can be used onehanded without training for the thumb olympics the xperia is maybe still just a little too wide for my hands but it gets the job done and the really tall aspect ratio is a really smart compromise that gives you good screen realestate without being a phablet the battery life here is respectable and i usually reach the end of my day with at least battery remaining it isnt a weekender battery but good enough for my purposes ive had better but ive also had a lot worse what i really appreciate on the xperia ii is the straightforward software experience the phone comes with something that feels pretty close to stock android without a bunch of bloat yet does come with some actually useful qualityoflife features such as side sense and an incredibly excellent camera app that gives you a proper manual mode the physical button to jump to the camera is awesome by the way theyre also keeping on top of security updates so far which is nice to see overall the device really feels like it gives you the control theres a ton of useful additions in the settings that let you customize the device instead of locking you into preferences that the developers wanted to force on you if i had to give a few criticisms of the xperia id say that it seems a bit overpriced for what you get though it does make sense if their audience is small that theyd have to charge more and the fingerprint sensor while in an excellent location seems to be hitormiss sometimes usually it causes no trouble but occasionally it will fail to read my fingerprint several times in a row heres hoping that this device will last me for years to come because this is the most enjoyable phone ive ever had the pleasure of owning,1,1,1
first off you have to really want a keyboard to make this purchase otherwise look somewhere else with that said here is my short bullet list review me millennial full time student work hours a week have personal clients dont play too many games pros very easy to manage schedule may take a minute to learn interface pretty simple after that so far the phone runs very smoothly love the quick feature reduces my search app time as well as my home screen clutter the screen quality is good all pictures and videos are nice and clear the weight is good not too light not too heavy i get complemented on my phone who would have thought keyboard has a nice matte allowing better tactile response great battery life possibly bcs it has a new battery cons speaker sux the quality isnt bad but it definitely doesnt sound as good as my iphone front camera sux i will never use it typing and holding the phone takes some getting used too due to it being top heavy can only adjust screen brightness not the most sturdy phone out there its built with quality but a lot of plast too additional info phone comes with some bloatware not much different than my iphone se or my samsung s rear camera is ok blackberry softwear is trying a bunch of stuff ex bb hub not my thing but you may like it overall i think its a great phone for someone longing for a keyboard if not then i thin you can find a better phone for the price point,1,1,1
if you are an american and not on verizon then the only true flagship available to you in november of is the enormous lumia a year old already the lumia is not a flagship ppi screen resolution is one of many shortcomings that leaves the lumia i will not review the phone itself here since there are many reviews on the internet mashable cnet engaget etc that you can look at to learn what an amazing device this is i will only add that those reviews are out of date since the phone was released over a year ago and you should take the following into account the app selection has increased substantially since this phone was released vine instagram uber among many other major apps are now available microsoft and nokia have released a number of meaningful updates shutter lag was a problem when the was first released but firmware updates since then have addressed this substantially and the nokia smart cam app takes a burst of photos so you wont miss action shots anymore shutter lag is not a big issue anymore i can confirm that without a sim card inserted this device upgraded all the way to windows os version see attached screenshot this means it has a fully functional cortana as well as a notification bar and the windows phone version of androids swipe which works quite well i also own a nexus tablet the is unlikely to receive any more updates but it should be more than able to hold its own until a proper successor is released i will also add that with a tmobile sim card inserted it picked up lte immediately in downtown san francisco see screenshot of notification screen also new with windows phone this is the rm device which is compatible with the tmobile lte bands the amazon merchant phonesselling was okay the phone was definitely new but the box was not suggesting it was oem but really who cares the phone ships from texas by usps and reached me in business days in san francisco,1,2,1
the computer itself works well my problem was that i was unaware of how windows in s mode effectively makes it like an apple computer restricting ones access to only that which you can get at the microsoft store during the set up it asked me if i wanted safe mode to be active or not and that i could turn it off later if i wanted to do so i left it activated and went through the rest of set up when i tried to load chrome and gmail windows did everthing possible to practically force me to use edge windows then said i would have to get out of s mode to load chromse and initially i didnt want to do that so i left chrome off i then tried to load and activate nortaon deluxe and all i could surmise is safe mode was blocking my ability to activate safe web extension in chrome i was an hour with norton tech support who then said i had to pay to continue receiving tech support which hadnt help to that point and then independenly spent more time trying to shut off safe mode in windows nothing worked so much for easy to shut off later i was tempted to put it back to out of box mode and start the initialization process again so i could turn off safety mode with it came up it then occurred to me that when loading chrome i was asked if i wanted to shut it down so i went ahead with downloading chrome and getting out of safety mode at the same time ever since it has been working better but only time will tell i was almost tempted to return the unit because of this problem but i think i got it to the point it works well enough and i have too much time into it to want to see that all thrown away the strange thing is i had just initiallized windows on another new laptop and none of these problems i will now avoid windows with safe mode like the plague and tell others to do the same,1,1,1
i got this phone as amazon warehouse item with a good discount from the new item price it would be a less value if i have to pay the new unit price the phone came with its original box w charger and cable even the sim card pin is there there is no screen protector on the screen but i saw no obvious sign of scratches on both front and back may be those very very picky people will point some very micro sign of screen been wiped by cloth for the price i paid i would more than happy to live with it the model number of the unit is also the us version kb as described the display screen is flat for a change i really hate those so call d or d curved edge display screens that are hard to view at edge and hard to find a good screen protector the back is still glass that while it may looks good provide no piratical value and make it easy to break i prefer carbon composite backs that are far more durable the phone feels comfortable in hand but as mention the glass back may feel at bit slip at times a case probably is need an that really negate the purpose of glass back which the phone makers stop making these silly designs as for the phone itself it runs on one plus version of android the only bloatware i want to remove but could not is the netflix app this is a dual sim phone which is the most important decision making factor too many us version phones has this function disabled i was annoyed by the sim card holder however that put one sim card on each side this means one card is upside down when insert or pulling the card holder this is the st dual sim phone i got uses this type of sim holder it is not convenient and prone to touch the contacts and zap it with static charge it was also a bit difficult to secure sim card in place to hold it firmly without dropping out when upside down the volume control is on the left side of the phone instead of like many others on the right on top the power button that position is now for the ring mutevibrate switch i would have proffered the volume is on the right so far the finger print sensor works fine even with cheap screen protector but i prefer on that is on the back instead of under screen the screen display is good with color reproduction since i dont play game cant really tell the benefit from my previous phone hz to this hz refresh rate wifi is fine with wifi or ax with wpa it does not support the new e or the ghz band but e is not that great in real use anyway wifi speed download is on par with ipad pro peak around mbps when in the same room with the router and around mbps two rooms away the upload speed however this phone beats the ipad by significant margin this phone works with tmobile without any problem in either g or g in my area the tmobile signal is on the weak side so i would show the test speed here as it is not a fair assessment of the phone the wifi calling functions works most of time but some time it kind of while maintain connection but can not hear to talk to the other side of the line this may not be the problem of the phone as other phones suffer the same problem from time to time cameras are ok i suppose i use real camera to take phone so phone camera is not a as important factor as to others the big disappointment is the battery life this phone drain a lot of energy when just using the wifi online not only one charge would not last full day with mostly wifi and min cell usage even when just surfing online with wifi a regular v a usb charger can not keep pace the the battery drain although the included w charger can do the job a laptop power adapter these days are mostly w another annoying issue is when the phone is locked and someone called and i answered i have yet to find a way to unlock the phone without hanging up all my previous android phones are able to unlock the phone when talking which may be needed to find some thing while talking overall for the price i paid i am happy with it but may not be so at higher price tag,1,1,0

got this set for work because i needed to replace the ones i was using the steel color appealed to me right away as did the price i wasnt expecting a lot of them because i mostly listen to audiobooks online comedy on iheart classical music and concerts on youtube while i work plus im no audio expert and cant wax expertly on the technicalities of all things electronicrelated those reviews are kinda difficult to read anyway so i really like these as you can see from the pics they come with lots of ear tips some are silicone some are foam rubberlike i especially like that there was a red pair because i could use one to quickly distinguish between l and r with my previous set i took a little piece of washi tape from my daughters craft items to wrap around one of the ear bud wires to distinguish them i didnt recall a little clip would come with the set so i was surprised to find it all the tips were in a ziplock baggie and the clip was with them theres also a little pouch but i wont need that these will remain connected to my computer at work i do like the set came in a box lined with foam to hold the buds and connector in place by the way the connector is brass so thats good i dont know why thats good specifically but i just seem to think that should be better im sure an audio expert could tell you about it or tell you im wrong and stupid as for the wires they dont seem to twirl tangle or kink so thats good and the joint where they separate to each ear has pretty good cover to protect them and keep the joint immobile is that a word anyway for the price theyre pretty darn good and actually look pricier im pretty pleased with these and will order another set for when my daughters earbuds stop working or get lost oh and yes the sound quality is good update ok so the foam rubber ear tips arent very good theyre comfortable but they really have nothing that can make them stay on the earbuds there have been several times where i have to remove the earbuds only to discover the tip is still in my ear theyre not so small that theyll fall into the ear but its still pretty unexpected and annoying going to have to switch to the silicone tips im going to miss having one a different color to distinguish the left from the right quickly but oh well,1,1,1

first the audio quality is incredible for phonecalls and music onto my issues first i have normal sized ears and these sort of get pushed out every minutes of listening and i have to push them back in second if i am listening to music and the no touch mode is on meaning that the touch buttons dont work except for volume when i receive a phone call the no touch mode turns itself off every time and if i dont turn it back on manually every time then without fail ill hang up on who im talking to every time when i go to push my headphones back in third insanely expensive i understand theres nothing else on the market thats this good for this price but i still hate it,1,1,0
this phone does have a mah battery it may incorrectly report a text value of to some tools but if you use something like accubattery which measures capacity based on the time it takes to charge at a certain current you will see the correct capacity see screenshot working well on att for me though i cant yet try g in my area,1,1,1

update after using these earbuds pretty much daily for about six months the charger case has died last night unplugged it in and it just wouldnt charge the earbuds have been going strong one even recovering from being briefly dropped in water but without the charger case they are of no use original review ive had these earbuds and used them for a while now and i really like them ive used various kinds of bluetooth headsets over the past few years because im a stayathome mom i almost always use only one earbud at a time need to be able to hear those kiddos so i thought that these might work better than some of the previous earbud headsets ive used that are connected overall i am very pleased with them things to note charging case i love being able to wear one earbud until it has a low battery then switch it out for the one that has been in the case i can do this several times over several days before needing to charge the case good for phone calls both earbuds have mics and i am able to do phone calls with either one some bluetooth headsets ive used in the past have not had good sound for callseither i cant hear well or my caller cant or the caller gets too much background noise i have had no problems with these good sound ok im no audiophile so i dont know if everyone will love the sound on these but i find them clear and crisp for both spoken word and music not airpods so this is a minor point but i love that these are not the ubiquitous airpods that i see sticking out of ears everywhere i feel like they arent as noticeable since they are dark and sit in the ear tip if you like me tend to use these one at time instead of together go ahead and pair them with each other anyway pair one then take the other out if the case and let them pair together when i first got these i paired one then turned it off put it back in the case and had to unpair it before i could pair the other it was a pain then one of my kids took one out of the case to look at it while i was wearing the other and they pairsled together now im able to switch from one to another put one in the case and take the other out to use without going through any additional steps who knew battery life the battery life on these is not as long as most of the aroundtheneck headsets ive used before but for me this isnt an issue because im always able to swap out to a fully charged earbud range i havent experimented with range but it feels similar to most other bluetooth sets ive used in the past,1,1,1
this review is for playing sound i have not tested these for making phone calls i have a hubby that snores really loudly i bought these with the hope that i could drown out some of the sound they are very comfortable when sleeping on my side and the cord is long enough to put my cell phone on my beside table with plenty of extra length due to their small size they can fall out as i get comfortable to sleep but i just pop them back in with not much trouble if you have a larger ear canal diameter these may not work for you there is no way to adjust the earbud size as it is all one piece sound quality seems okay dont expect much for the price two notes these are not noise cancelling but they work ask written they reduce noise by by being inserted into the entrance of the ear canal they can mask noise just as well as other ear buds there is no builtin volume control the button on the mic stops and starts music you can also doubleclick to skip to the next song i have not tested the button during phone calls playing white noise through these over the past week have improved my sleep quality from a fitbit sleep score of around into the low s and i am getting a lot more deep sleep during the night i cant say that the improvement is completely from these earbuds vs the white noise but combination is definitely helping stars for price and comfortable during sleep they are doing everything i need them to do be comfortable when i sleep on my side,1,2,1

i did receive my item very quicklyi did have issues with it when i first bought it i had difficulty hearing when i received or tried to call someone using the phone i did contact customer support they sent a link for me to contact apple as they were the manufacture apple did set me up with an appointment to have it checked out they did fix the sound issue but also told me i had faulty microphone so evidently everything is not exactly checked out to make it like new when you buy a renewed phone this was the second pro that i bought through amazon amazon the first one i sent right back on that note i do like the phone i think i will try out my phone for a bit to see if i have any more issues before i see if i need to send it back it does have a warranty i did buy an otterbox case for it which i like really well i hope this helps anyone that is looking for a phone,1,1,1

you need to get this the u is basically the same as the u and absolutely smokes the u in gaming very light gaming but beats both in multithreading applications the u is a ct cpu where as the u and u are a ct cpu but the u is slightly worse than the u you definitely get more bang for your buck with the u ps the only downside is that there is only one slot for storage and its a mini m nvme but it looked like you could upgrade to a full size m drive also there is gb of ram soldered to the motherboard but it does have an empty slot to put an gb stick of ram i would get one thats mhz cl theyre like and will drastically improve the performance,1,1,1
i bought one of these unlocked cell phones motorola razr unlocked international version theyre unlocked only in the strictest sense of the word these phones are branded meaning theyve got some carriers logo on them and more importantly theyve got a crippled version of the phone software now the razr is a very cool phone but its only as good as the software that makes it actually work the att software i had would not allow you to make separate profiles and it required you to log on to only the att network to get ring tones wallpaper etc all fine if youre an att customer but this completely misses the point of buying an unlocked cell phone in the first place i tried to fix the situation by reflashing ie putting on generic useful software that comes with a truly unlocked phone see eg as soon as i did that the phone seized up and demanded a subsidy password the phone really wasnt unlocked at all if you want a phone that is truly unlocked and unbranded buy it from one of the european amazon sites youll spend a little more but youll get what you actually want in the end,1,0,0

this is mostly a review on either amazon or oneplus fulfillment abilities at the moment i put in an order for an ultramarine blue pro two weeks ago only for my order to get delayed and to put salt on the wound i finally got the package today only to reveal a standard in interstellar glow not sure who screwed up here but im just letting anyone interested know that getting theses phones in your hands is a process right now will update once i finally get the correct device update received the correct phone within the same week amazon guarantees that you will receive the correct item within business days of receiving the returned item which seems to happen even if its out of stock they must have some in reserve just in case say what you will about amazon but their customer service is top notch if youre deciding between ordering off of onepluss website vs amazon definitely go amazon for their service and accountability stock still seems to be an issue so if youre willing to wait a month or so for that to steady im sure you will encounter a much smoother experience than i did the phone itself absolutely flies and the ultramarine is straight up gorgeous quite an upgrade from my chugging galaxy s however no phone is worth the price premium gougers are charging when out of stock the wait will be worth it overall id rate everything a but amazon doesnt do half stars,1,2,0

first there are better laptops for the cost but you will be seeing and inch screens when looking for those this is a mediocre performing screen but it is a excellent inch p screen you can play some games on it on the lowest settings but that isnt why you get this guy you get it because of the screen size and work as a work computer there are somethings that are also mediocre the ram isnt the problem as the u processor was upgraded to support ddr however the u processor is also mediocre wherein the processor is a zen processor with only cores and threads threads total as each core hosts two threads the zen is a functional processor node though but it is a old one think back on the ryzen series processors there is a light though though dim and that is the rdna gpu it is a onboard m gpu which is standard in the lineup that are not g series processors it has stream processors unified shader cores think cuda from nvidia this is not a lot of gpu power though as a g series processor could have up to stream processors what is weird is that they added ray tracing cores onto this gpu which confuses me as i see nothing that would work well with and likely this is ripped from a larger gpu cluster and made into a module this is great though for video web based games and things like accounting or other work requiring numbers or typing there is a number pad and another mediocre part the keyboard there is a lot of flex in the keyboard especially in the middle i opened it up to find minimal bracing and the motherboard directly below the keyboard so no hulk smash of the keyboard less you want a broken one interesting notes though there isnt much for upgrades here you can upgrade the network card and the nvme ssd drive repairability is higher though with separate daughter board for the left io ports usb audio as well as the power port not being on the motherboard making the proprietary cord for power a bit easier to repair in the future if or when it breaks though i do wish that they allowed for charging through the usb port that was a letdown to find it does not charge through the usbc port which means i can not use my dock to charge it also means they did not make use of usbc which is not native to the processor which only support gen opening it up though did reveal a good system for removing heat allowing that there is proper clearance under the unit i was happy with the cooling solution though and even think it was more than actually required the motherboard used quality parts and i love that they are repurposing a battery for a more universal fit situation this decreases cost for hp and increases options for repair in the future the ssd was a samsung unit looked like it was a all in one controller with a side ddr memory module either that or the module was the controller and it was ddrless but i trust samsung as a part and think this is a good one to have all in one controller for nvme means that both the nvme processor and memory are found on one unit first instance i found of this was small nvme units from kioxia formerly known as toshiba inside the hp there wasnt anything i was really disappointed at though with one exception the exception was the screen hinges the hinge system reminded me of hp engineering of the late s think hp was one of the worst companies at that point as a tech that had to repair them but by i was seeing more and more options that were great getting back to the hinges there may not be a problem if they tuned the tension correctly however they are using the same setup of metal inside plastic housing and i have seen so many times how that fails requiring replacement of part of the laptops body and sometimes even the screen or wire harness there is no additional bracing to prevent flex in the area as well though the bottom is deep and works well another thing repairing this will require that you remove the bottom feet to access five hidden screws once out and tight line on the upper section of the body attaches the bottom to the top of the body assembly via clips guitar picks and plastic pry tools will be required to gently coax the two halves apart the good news is you only have to open this unit up for repairs only and likely well past the warranty there is no major reason to be accessing the inside when so little inside is capable of upgrades or replacement the screen on this inch laptop is actually the best part of this unit things like keyboard flex and unmentioned till now key mushiness are likely the worst things for this laptop other things like underwhelming processor are more of a amd thing though is a great entry to a new laptop when i first got this they were talking about for the price and that is not worth it now it is as of writing this while not being on sale and that is a better price though i was thinking when i was looking at it part wise so i was close only thing i would be considering as a worry point is those screen hinges though i would love to see some sort of structural brace inside these in the future though where that would help with the keyboard flex little bonus this unit does have a built in camera shutter so you can manually close the camera off sound on this isnt stellar but it is good overall for what it is i can recommend it at but with the caveat of watching the pressure you put on the screen when opening it if you do want better than this laptop you will be looking at either smaller ones older models or larger cost units,1,1,1
reason for the ruku purchase instead of samsung or sony was because you cant buy a normal tv anymore without the smart bloatware in it i always end up buying a ruku stick anyways so i get to skip that step and just the tv with ruku built in it so far im satisfied with my purchase,1,2,1
the size is larger but it doesnt feel larger the best fingerprint reader yet,1,1,1
i bought this during black friday sale for us before taxes i kind of relied on the reviews specially the one by rtings the main reason i chose this is because it supposedly had the best pricetobrightness ratio i completely made up the term here i placed it in a bright room directly opposite to the big window so tv had have good brightness and good antiglare while the tv can get quite bright increasing the brightness causes the picture to get washed to the point it is unwatchable antiglare or whatever the technical term is is decent but not great in general picture quality is decent but definitely wobt blow anyones mind one persistent problem i have with the tv is the bluetooth connectivity i exclusively use bl headphones to watch but if my bl headphone gets disconnected i have to unpair my headphones from the tv and then repair it there is no simple reconnect option which seems like a nobrainer dont know if this an android issue or hisense issue also i dont understand why i have to have a hisense account to connect my echo show to the tv that seems unnecessarily stupid other than that my experience has been good the tv hasnt shown any unstability issues hulu has hiccupped few times but other than that it has been completely fine for dollars this is not a bad purchase,1,1,0

before purchasing a laptop i looked around to weigh the options this one ticked all my boxes although yours may be different it said it came with win home it does not it comes with win in safe mode not a huge deal getting it out of safe mode is relatively easy once out of safe mode you can dl a good browser install it and then youll have to go into the settings network and internet browser and change the default browser to your preference this is the only reason i didnt give it stars and only because doing this takes time and patience if you havent before the description should be changed i read a review that said it wouldnt support an external monitor from usb but that isnt true i connected a separate touchscreen external monitor to it and it works fine it takes a usb to usb c cable and a hdmi cable to work and its worth mentioning i am not a computer genius or tech savvy by any means the laptop is quite thin and lightweight which is important to those on the go i am not on the go anymore so it doesnt affect me but i want to be impartial im not a fan of win but after a couple of days it is at least navigable i did spend those couple of days just turning things off like reporting to microsoft every little detail it seems theres a dozen or so of these settings that can be difficult to find wonder why they did that all in all i am happy with the laptop and hope it does its job in the future i would recommend it to others for sure as long as they know they need to modify it to release the better features,1,1,1
as advertised the internet connection make the tv functions like a roku channel videos are dated not current stuff,1,0,1
purchased the for under i like that samsung tv makes it easy to watch free tv like national news setup was easy with wifi or ethernet cable the remote isnt great coming from a roku premier with radio having to point the ir remote is annoying i was also surpised it didnt have a voice search button it works with samsung smart things and has a smartphone remote option it paired nicely with my denon avr to get surround sound using hdmi arc after an audio setting change the first one came smashed which was dissapointing but easily replaced they picked up the return insted of having to drop it off,1,1,1
